Essex towns swept the board with Harlow, Braintree and Southend also named by CBRE in the top 10 list of affordable towns for commuters travelling into the capital to live.<br/><br/>Basildon also benefits from being on the C2C train line, which runs between London Fenchurch Street and Shoeburyness.<br/><br/>According to CBRE, one million people commute into London every day for work and in a recent train satisfaction survey by consumer group Which? C2C is ranked third out of 19 firms. Part of the appeal of Basildon is <strong>a journey time of 35 minutes into London’s</strong> Fenchurch Street with an annual season ticket costing £2684 which is significantly cheaper than fares from other London commuter belt towns.<br/><br/>Basildon also tops the list due to its <strong>reasonable house prices </strong>with an average house price in the town, £176,886.</p><blockquote><p>“The combination of a lower average house price with affordable train fares into the capital means that areas such as Basildon, Luton and Harlow have maintained their top three positions for increased value for money in London's commuter belt.”</p></blockquote><p>Jennet Siebrits, head of residential research at CBRE</p><p><strong>Cheapest Commuter Towns</strong><br/><br/>1.
