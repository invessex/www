<p><img alt='Cambridge Essex UK High Technology Cluster' src='../uploads/blog/CEUHTC_icon_landscape_600.jpg' style='width: 600px; height: 170px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;'/></p><h3><span style='line-height: 1.2;'>When high-technology companies consider new locations for expansion projects, access to a skilled specialist workforce is a key consideration</span></h3><p><img alt='Essex UK: a specialist high-technology manufacturing workforce' src='../uploads/general/e2v_cleanroom_(2)_700.jpg' style='width: 400px; float: right; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; height: 300px;'/>In Essex, growing businesses are finding that they can access a high-quality local workforce, in addition to large numbers of skilled technology workers living in the commutable cities of Cambridge and London.</p><h3>Access to the combined labour forces of Essex, Cambridge and London…</h3><p>Essex itself is home to 43,500 skilled manufacturing workers [1], making it one of southern England’s foremost advanced manufacturing locations. For businesses, this local workforce is complemented by the large –scale labour forces of Cambridge – home to more than 50,000 tech workers [2] – and London – home to almost 200,000 tech workers. [3] From each of these leading ‘tech hub’ cities, key Essex business locations including <a href='http://investessex.co.uk/studies/place-studies/harlow_enterprise' target='_blank'>Harlow Enterprise Zone</a> can be accessed in less than 1 hour.

This specialism is reflected in the size of the county’s electronics workforce. In key ‘high-technology’ SIC categories including ‘manufacturing of electronics components and boards’ (C261), Essex has a significantly larger workforce than competitor locations in the East of England, including Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire.</p><h3>Combined with low wage costs…</h3><p><iframe class='essexchart' frameborder='0' height='500px' src='http://essexcharts.appspot.com/esx2-9.html' width='100%'></iframe></p><p>The availability of skilled workers in Essex is complemented by low wage costs that ensure the county’s competitiveness as a high-technology business location. Companies locating in Essex can benefit from significant average wage cost savings versus London, Cambridge and alternative technology locations in southern England. And, surprisingly for a technology cluster so close to London, average wages are actually 2% lower than the UK average.

But so is a continuous ‘pipeline’ of skilled workers, delivered by specialist education institutions. In Essex, further education colleges including <a href='http://www.procat.ac.uk/' target='_blank'>PROCAT</a> (Prospects College of Advanced Technology) and the <a href='http://www.sircharleskaoutc.com/about/specialisms/' target='_blank'>Sir Charles Kao UTC</a> (University Technical College) work in close partnership with local companies to deliver workers with the specific high-technology skills they require. And the close proximity of world-class universities in Cambridge, London and Essex itself ensures access to the very best technology graduates, across disciplines including ICT and electronics.</p><h3>Sustaining a growing high-technology sector…</h3><p>International high-technology businesses including <a href='us-investment-in-essex#.V16FetIrLIU' target='_blank'>Raytheon</a> and <a href='us-investment-in-essex#.V16FetIrLIU' target='_blank'>Arrow Electronics</a> are expanding in Essex UK, and the county’s skilled workforce has been a key consideration in each of those companies’ location decisions. Essex’s distinctive combination of a large, affordable technology labour force, and a specialist skills pipeline, means that the county is well positioned to welcome many more leading high-technology companies.</p><h3>FIND OUT MORE</h3><p>Contact <a href='../index.html' target='_blank'>INVEST Essex</a><strong> </strong>to find out more about the Cambridge-Essex UK High-Technology Cluster.</p><p><strong>Sources:</strong><br/>[1] ONS Nomis<br/>[2] Cambridge Network: <a href='http://www.cambridgenetwork.co.uk/directories/cambridge-cluster/' target='_blank'>http://www.cambridgenetwork.co.uk/directories/cambridge-cluster/</a><br/>[3] Stack Overflow: London &amp; Partners, 2015: <a href='http://www.londonandpartners.com/media-centre/press-releases/2015/20150929-london-leads-the-world-for-tech-talent' target='_blank'>http://www.londonandpartners.com/media-centre/press-releases/2015/20150929-london-leads-the-world-for-tech-talent</a><br/>[4] Google Maps, 2015</p>
