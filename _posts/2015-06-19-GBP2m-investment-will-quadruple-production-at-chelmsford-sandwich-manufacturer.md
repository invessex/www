<p><img alt='Award winning sandwich manufacturer Raynor Foods' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Raynors_foods_300.jpg' style='float:right; height:183px; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px; width:275px'/>Chelmsford based sandwich manufacturer Raynor Foods is set to quadruple production and create 65 new jobs with a £2m capital investment.<br/><br/>The company is to replace its three manufacturing lines, which have a production capacity of 10M products a year, with six new lines capable of making more than 40 million products when the company moves into new premises later this year.</p><blockquote><p>“It’s a 1,858m² state-of-the-art facility that will have six production lines and it’s a massive increase in our capacity.”<br/>Mark Raynor, Managing Director (MD), Raynor Foods</p></blockquote><p><strong>Investment leading to expansion</strong><br/>Raynors Foods currently supply colleges, hotels, schools, universities, garages and other outlets with sandwiches. New customers and businesses will be sought to make full use of the new site’s capacity. There are also plans to install a ‘free-from’ line to accommodate customers with wheat and gluten intolerances.</p><blockquote><p>“We’re planning to use our old production facilities as a free-from line, which will mean more investment. There’s a proportion of the population that wants to reduce or limit their intake of things like gluten and we feel we can cater to that.”<br/>Mark Raynor, MD, Raynor Foods</p></blockquote><p><strong>About Raynor Foods</strong><br/>The family run business first started as a wholesale cake supplier and expanded into the pre-packaged sandwich industry. This year they won the British Sandwich Association Technical Excellence Award.</p><blockquote><p>“We picked up the ‘SAMMIE’ award for teaching other sandwich businesses how to produce food safely. We’re trying to set the benchmark for the industry and so we’re doing the teaching.”<br/>Mark Raynor, MD, Raynor Foods</p></blockquote><p>Source [<a href='https://www.caterlyst.com/c3t/insight/Sector.aspx?t=20&amp;n=10284' target='_blank'>Caterlyst</a>]</p>
