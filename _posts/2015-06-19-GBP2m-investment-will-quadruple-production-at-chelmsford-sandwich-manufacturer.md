New customers and businesses will be sought to make full use of the new site’s capacity. There are also plans to install a ‘free-from’ line to accommodate customers with wheat and gluten intolerances.</p><blockquote><p>“We’re planning to use our old production facilities as a free-from line, which will mean more investment. There’s a proportion of the population that wants to reduce or limit their intake of things like gluten and we feel we can cater to that.”<br/>Mark Raynor, MD, Raynor Foods</p></blockquote><p><strong>About Raynor Foods</strong><br/>The family run business first started as a wholesale cake supplier and expanded into the pre-packaged sandwich industry. This year they won the British Sandwich Association Technical Excellence Award.</p><blockquote><p>“We picked up the ‘SAMMIE’ award for teaching other sandwich businesses how to produce food safely. We’re trying to set the benchmark for the industry and so we’re doing the teaching.”<br/>Mark Raynor, MD, Raynor Foods</p></blockquote><p>Source [<a href='https://www.caterlyst.com/c3t/insight/Sector.aspx?t=20&amp;n=10284' target='_blank'>Caterlyst</a>]</p>
