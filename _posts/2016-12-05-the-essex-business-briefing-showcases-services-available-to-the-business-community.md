Recent topics that have been covered at the briefings include why innovation is important to businesses and the threat of cybercrime.</p><h3>Innovation forum</h3><p><img alt='‘Innovation: The Catalyst for Growth’ forum' src='http://www.investessex.co.uk/uploads/about/Innovation_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 299px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>The Autumn Essex Business Briefing forum was held with the theme of ‘Innovation: The Catalyst for Growth’. Studies have confirmed that all businesses want to be more innovative. Innovation has become a major factor in influencing strategic planning and it has been acknowledged that innovation leads to wealth creation. The conclusion is that the importance of innovation is increasing, and increasing significantly.</p><p>At the forum guest speakers from The Ideas Centre Group, NatWest and Flakt Woods discussed their experience of managing innovation by unleashing the creativity within their workforce. An extended Q&amp;A session to a full house of delegates discussed how to help them deliver the best service.</p><blockquote><p>“We live in a rapidly changing world with huge opportunities for innovation – but businesses and individuals often get stuck in outdated approaches that have exceeded their ‘best before date.”</p><p>Alex Menhams, Partner, The Ideas Centre Group</p></blockquote><h3>Cybercrime forum</h3><p><img alt='Ian Morehouse speech' src='http://www.investessex.co.uk/uploads/about/Ian_Morehouse_2_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 299px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>A previous forum held by the Essex Business Briefing covered the topic of cybercrime and the threats posed to businesses from a supplier perspective. With UK businesses reporting losses of £1,079,447,765 in the past year, according to figures released by Get Safe Online and the UK’s national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre Action Fraud, cyber-security is now taking centre stage as business leaders seek protection from attacks.</p><p>At the forum guest speakers from Glasswall Solutions and Barclays Bank highlighted the sophistication of today’s criminals and measures needed to safeguard against cyber-attacks to business operations.</p><p>Glasswall Solutions, who has developed an innovative technology that provides protection against inbound cyber threats, recently won the Cybersecurity category in the 2016 Institution of Engineering and Technology Innovation Awards.</p><blockquote><p>“If the new focus on cyber-security is to work, however, all involved need to realise that constantly-evolving threats require constant innovation, rather than just post-infection Band-aid. Criminals have moved on from what are commonly called signature-based threats, to instead placing increased attention to altering the structure of common file-types to defeat existing security and anti-virus solutions and breach an organisation's defences”.</p><p>Sam Hutton, CTO, Glasswall Solutions</p></blockquote><h3>About the Essex Business Briefing</h3><p><img alt='Essex Business Briefing partners' src='http://www.investessex.co.uk/uploads/about/EBB_Event_Partners_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 299px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>The Essex Business Briefing was established to create awareness of the Essex professional support network for businesses.
