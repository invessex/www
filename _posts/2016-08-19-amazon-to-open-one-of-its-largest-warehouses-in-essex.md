The four storey warehouse will be one of Amazon’s biggest developments in the South East of England. </span></p><p>Amazon will be a key tenant at the London Distribution Park development at the Port of Tilbury occupying a new four storey 550,000sq ft (51,100sq m) warehouse. Once completed, the warehouse will provide over 2 million sq ft (186,000sq m) of floorspace and is expected to create over 3,500 jobs once fully operational.</p><blockquote><p>“It’s great news that Amazon has chosen Essex as a place to do business with its new warehouse at the Port of Tilbury in Thurrock.</p><p>With 1500 jobs to be created next year at the new warehouse, the move will be a fantastic boost to economic growth in the county. I’m really pleased that Invest Essex, our inward investment team at Essex County Council, has been able to support Amazon to find this location and show once again that Essex means business!”</p><p>Cllr Kevin Bentley, Cabinet Member for Economic Growth and Partnerships</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“This is great news for the port and for the Thurrock area. We are delighted that Amazon will be based at London Distribution Park (LDP).

It has been a long time coming since our initial discussions which were facilitated through INVEST Essex back in 2014.</p><p>The 2.2 million sq ft facility will be largest of its kind in the UK and initially employ 1,500 and open in Spring 2017. The Port is well placed for Amazon to maximise their supply chain routings and we look forward to working with them to make this happen.”</p><p><br/>Perry Glading, Chief Operating Officer, Forth Ports Ltd</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>'<span style='line-height: 1.6;'>Amazon is another global brand investing in Thurrock, which we are very happy to be partnered with. </span><span style='line-height: 1.6;'>This significant venture in the borough will act as the catalyst to secure investment in transport links, improve the local environment as well as creating employment opportunities for local people. </span><span style='line-height: 1.6;'>The new centre is extremely well placed in terms of road and distribution networks in the South East as well as benefiting from neighbouring logistical experts like Port of Tilbury.'</span></p><p>Cllr Mark Coxshall, Portfolio Holder for Regeneration, Thurrock Council</p></blockquote><h3>Meeting increasing customer demand</h3><p>Amazon is increasing the size of its UK fulfilment centre network to meet increasing customer demand, expand its product selection of more than 150 million items and support the needs of a growing number of independent small businesses selling on Amazon Marketplace using Fulfilment by Amazon warehousing and delivery.</p><p>The Tilbury fulfilment centre will be equipped with the latest and most advanced Amazon Robotics technology which launched earlier this year in the UK at Amazon’s fulfilment centres in Dunstable and Doncaster.</p><blockquote><p>“We are excited to announce that we will be opening our 13th fulfilment centre in the UK in Tilbury in spring 2017 to enable us to continue to expand our product selection, support more third party sellers including small businesses with our fulfilment expertise and meet growing customer demand in the UK.”</p><p><br/>John Tagawa, Amazon’s Vice President of UK Operations</p></blockquote><h3>A location accessing one of Europe’s biggest consumer markets</h3><p><img alt='London Distribution Park' src='//clarity-strategies.github.io/ie-uploads/uploads/about/Screen-Shot-2016-05-30-at-22.36.34_400.jpg' style='line-height: 20.8px; width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/></p><p>The site of Amazon’s new warehouse, the London Distribution Park, is a 70 acre industrial and logistics development with unique locational advantages, alongside the  Port of Tilbury on the River Thames and immediately adjacent to London.

The warehouse development, a joint partnership between developers Roxhill and the Port of Tilbury, will be situated within one of Europe's biggest consumer markets with around 18 million people living within a radius of 75 miles.</p><blockquote><p>“This is excellent news for London Distribution Park. The strategic location adjacent to the port of Tilbury is a major asset for businesses and we welcome Amazon to the development. London Distribution Park is currently the largest ready to go industrial development site closest to the M25 on the market. We have already secured Amazon and Travis Perkins and we continue to see an increase in the number of businesses looking for distribution centres located in or near a busy port.”</p><p><br/>Jason Dalby, Managing Director, Roxhill Developments</p></blockquote><h3>About the Port of Tilbury</h3><p><img alt='Port of Tilbury' src='//clarity-strategies.github.io/ie-uploads/uploads/about/A_general_view_of_a_container_vessel_at_Tilbury_Docks_400.jpg' style='line-height: 20.8px; width: 400px; height: 299px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/></p><p>The Port of Tilbury is one of the largest deep water ports on the River Thames and the closest port to the City of London.
