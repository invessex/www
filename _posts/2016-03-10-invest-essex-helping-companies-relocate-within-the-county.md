The same accommodation would cost £662,000 less per year in Essex than in the UK’s regional core cities [1]. INVEST Essex can highlight the significant cost advantages of Essex to their clients.</p><h3>Finding the best property solution</h3><p>INVEST Essex (IE) works with UK and foreign based companies helping them settle in Essex and thrive in a location on the doorstep of London and Cambridge. IE has recently been working with two companies to expand and settle in the county…</p><p><img alt='Prelude Consulting ' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Prelude_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 264px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>Skilful.co, a specialist online training company, took advice from INVEST Essex on the best property solution for their needs when they realised they needed space in which to expand. After having been presented a number of property options the company have been able to relocate whilst still retaining a base in Black Notley, Essex, where they can consolidate their life management and professional skills business, Skilful.co.</p><p>Contact the INVEST Essex team <a href='../how-we-can-help' target='_blank'>here</a> to find a property solution for your business.</p><h3>Integrating into the local MedTech sector</h3><p>INVEST Essex provides a free, bespoke and confidential service providing professional advice, guidance and intelligence to companies through every aspect of locating and doing business from the Essex/UK. When Australian medical device company, Fairmont Medical, were looking to establish a new UK office to expand their surgical and critical care equipment business INVEST Essex recommended Chelmsford, Essex, in which to base themselves.</p><p><img alt='Fairmont Medical' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Fairmont_surgical_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 299px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>Fairmont Medical were keen to integrate into the local medical technologies (MedTech) sector and INVEST Essex advised that Chelmsford, home to MedBIC, the Anglia Ruskin University Business Innovation Centre for Medical and Advanced Engineering, would be an ideal fit for them.
