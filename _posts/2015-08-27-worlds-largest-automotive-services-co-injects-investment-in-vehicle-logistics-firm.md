<p>	Movex, the Essex based online vehicle logistics firm, has received significant investment from Manheim, part of Cox Automotive the world’s largest automotive services business, who has acquired a majority shareholding.<br/><br/><img alt='Manheim part of Cox Automotive the world's largest automotive services business acquires majority shareholding in Movex' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Manheim_300.jpg' style='width: 300px; height: 160px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>Since its formation in 2012 Movex has enjoyed impressive success and business growth. With the strategic investment from Manheim the company now has significant potential for further growth in an immature market.</p><blockquote><p>		“The majority acquisition of Movex is a further demonstration of our commitment to investing in products and services to deliver greater value to our customers. The Movex platform is complementary to our existing business and we are now in the process of fully exploring the synergies that can be achieved.”<br/>		Michael Buxton, CEO, Manheim UK</p></blockquote><p><strong>About Movex</strong><br/>	Movex is the UK’s leading online vehicle logistics platform, facilitating around 40,000 vehicle collections and deliveries each year. Movex customers who need a vehicle moved simply upload their requirements to the platform where networks of approved transport providers are then able to submit quotes for the job.</p><blockquote><p>		“We know that our platform delivers major benefits to our existing customers and transport providers, and has the potential to be scaled up to meet rising demand in vehicle movements across the UK. Manheim clearly recognised this potential and we are incredibly excited to become part of the Manheim and wider Cox Automotive family.”<br/>		Daren Jones, Managing Director, Movex</p></blockquote><p><strong>Improving logistics efficiencies</strong><br/><img alt='Movex the UK's leading online vehicle logistics platform' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Transporter.jpg' style='width: 268px; height: 179px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>The Movex logistics platform allows transport providers to fill empty slots on transporters or return journeys.
