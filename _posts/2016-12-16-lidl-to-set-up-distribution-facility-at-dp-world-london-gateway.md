<p><a href='http://www.londongateway.com/news/press-releases/lidl-uk-establish-distribution-operations-dp-world-london-gateway-logistics-park/' target='_blank'><img alt='Logistics Centre' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/about/Press_release_image_700.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/></a>Lidl UK, one of the UK’s fastest growing supermarkets, is the latest company to sign up for a distribution facility at DP World’s London Gateway Logistics Park. From February 2017 Lidl will operate from a 187,000 sq ft warehouse at London Gateway. The logistics park’s strategic location will support the award-winning supermarket’s UK network of 640 stores and strengthen its growing presence within the UK.</p><p> </p><blockquote><p>“As we push forward with our UK expansion plans we continue to strengthen our core infrastructure in order to support our new and existing stores up and down the country. We are, therefore, pleased to have found a viable facility at DP World London Gateway Logistics Park that meets our current distribution requirements.”</p><p>Adrienne Howells, Head of Warehouse expansion, Lidl UK</p></blockquote><p>Essex is proving to be a prime location for international companies looking to set up distribution facilities. Lidl’s positioning at the logistics park follows courier giant UPS’ decision to build a £120million distribution centre at London Gateway which will act as a UK hub and distribution centre and a key gateway to UPS’s global transportation network.</p><h3>Developing logistics services at DP World London Gateway</h3><p><img alt='Lorries at the port' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/about/maxresdefault-1_Cropped.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>Logistics facilities are playing a vital role in maintaining and improving distribution times as the demand for on-line shopping services and fresh produce increases. The advantage of deep-sea port water access at DP World London Gateway is proving beneficial to developing logistics services; an integral part of the supply chain.</p><p> </p><p> </p><blockquote><p>“We are delighted to have been able to work with Lidl in providing a solution to this aspect of its rapidly expanding distribution operation in the UK. DP World London Gateway is exceptionally well positioned to help retailers and third party logistics businesses to decrease time and cost in their supply chains. Our team of experts are able to assist with solutions and with one of Europe’s largest land-banks for distribution warehousing, on the same estate as the UK’s most advanced deep-sea container ports, the advantages to cargo owners in utilising this facility are compelling.”</p><p>Oliver Treneman, Property Development Director, DP World London Gateway</p></blockquote><h3>What DP World London Gateway can offer</h3><p>London Gateway Logistics Park is located just to the east of DP World’s London Gateway Port, where a 560 acre area of land is under development which will become Europe’s largest logistics park. The logistics park has been planned to sit directly behind the dockside freight handling facilities and has full multi-modal transport infrastructure.</p><p><img alt='DP World London Gateway' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/about/DP_World_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 299px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>This combination of a deep-sea port and logistics park offers a port-centric solution in the best location with…</p><ul><li>Unrivalled facilities</li><li>Tri-modal connectivity</li><li>Unmatched safety, speed and reliability</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p>Located just 25 miles from central London, DP World London Gateway has 16 million consumers within 50 miles enabling ships to enter the UK closer to the key areas of consumption such as London, Birmingham and Manchester.
