The state-of-the-art datacentre called ‘Kao DATA’ will be part of a new UK Enterprise Zone. It will be one of the largest datacentres in the UK and the only datacentre near London to provide occupiers with over 200,000 square feet of grade A office space.</span></p><p>Kao DATA is aiming to attract a range of sector-specific life science businesses and organisations. Businesses will be able to take advantage of Kao DATA’s hyper-connectivity, secure data resilience and scalable flexibility to support them and their innovative research.</p><blockquote><p>“Kao DATA is strategically positioned close to London, along the UK’s burgeoning life science’s belt and will provide occupiers with secure data resilience to support their businesses and future research.”</p><p><br/>David Bloom, Director, Kao DATA</p></blockquote><h3>Data driven data centres</h3><p>Big data and data analytics are already proving to be of enormous benefit to many businesses helping businesses to improve operational efficiency, customer experience and create new business models.</p><p>Kao DATA will offer independent and world class data capacity for local, national and international companies across four freestanding buildings covering over 300,000 sq feet of space. A specialist commercial real estate team have been appointed to attract specific data occupiers for the 15 acre campus.</p><blockquote><p>“The connectivity that this site offers, both from a physical and virtual perspective, is unmatched. We expect to attract significant interest from both global occupiers and smaller organisations who want to benefit from this scalable and flexible site.”</p><p><br/>Mark Trevor, Senior Director, Cushman &amp; Wakefield</p></blockquote><h3>At the forefront of new technology</h3><p>Harlow's growing reputation as a science-led town, a reputation started in the 60’s with the development of Fibre Optic Technology by Nobel prize winner Charles Kao at Standard Telecommunication Laboratories (STL), continues today with the development of the Harlow Enterprise Zone a new development for advanced manufacturing and life sciences/medical technology businesses.</p><blockquote><p>“As the birthplace of fibre optics, Kao Park has the legacy, workforce and supporting infrastructure to provide a world class data centre campus.
