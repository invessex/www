The route will be London Stansted Airport’s first scheduled cargo link to Guangzhou, China’s third largest city.<br/><br/>China Southern Cargo will become the latest major carrier to join London Stansted Airport’s global cargo network and the airline will initially operate two flights a week.</p><blockquote><p>“We are delighted China Southern Cargo has selected London Stansted Airport as the base for its new UK service. It clearly demonstrates the returning confidence in trade between the two countries and is great news for businesses across UK, and in particular the eastern region looking to access the Chinese market. This is the culmination of several years of working with the airline and their partners to ensure we deliver this new service.”<br/>Andrew Harrison, Managing Director, London Stansted Airport</p></blockquote><p><strong>Providing direct access to Chinese markets</strong><br/>With a recent poll showing more than a third of all medium sized businesses in the East of England plan to increase their export levels in the next 12 months, the new cargo route is of particular interest and will reinforce the economic benefits to local businesses and the advantage of gaining direct access to Chinese markets.</p><blockquote><p>“The airport sits at the heart of the London-Stansted-Cambridge growth corridor, and with the region booming and London’s economic activity shifting towards the east, London Stansted Airport is ideally placed to support businesses trading internationally and looking to compete in the global market place.”<br/>Andrew Harrison, Managing Director, London Stansted Airport</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“It is an important milestone for China Southern cargo to launch this new freighter service from our hub in Guangzhou, China, to London Stansted Airport. We are excited by entering this growing market, with an aim to serve customer needs and strengthen the economic ties between our two countries.”<br/>Zhao Fengsheng, SVP Cargo China Southern</p></blockquote><p><strong>Highlighting the links Essex has with China</strong><br/><a href='http://www.investessex.co.uk/services/reach-international-markets' target='_blank'>Essex International</a>, Essex County Council’s International Trade Department, promotes exports to China and encourages Chinese companies to set up businesses and create new jobs in Essex.<br/><br/>Over the last quarter of a century, Essex International has helped hundreds of businesses to export into China and is able to provide unique access and offer the right connections to help businesses develop partnerships to help increase their presence in the Chinese market.</p><blockquote><p>“We welcome news of this new cargo flight to China, the only direct freight link between the UK and China – proof again that Essex Means Business and is the county to be for business growth. Essex has a long-established special link with China, and this new route will further strengthen it. Essex County Council is seeing increased interest in China from Essex businesses. Exports from the UK to China of traditional and luxury goods and education, plus environmental services and technologies, continue to grow.”<br/>Cllr Kevin Bentley, Essex County Council Cabinet Member for Economic Growth and Infrastructure</p></blockquote><p><strong>About London Stansted Airport cargo</strong><br/>More than 230,000 tonnes of freight is shipped annually on more than 11,000 cargo flights to over 200 countries from London Stansted Airport.
