Ventrica provides multilingual eCommerce customer management and communication services in a host of different European languages across a range of business sectors such as fashion, retail, insurance, finance, health, transport, construction and publishing.</p><p>Founded in 2010 during the peak of the recession, Ventrica has experienced phenomenal growth over the last few years and continues to expand with the opening of a Penthouse Suite contact centre which will increase the company’s footprint to 19,000 sq ft and extend its provision from 280 to 480 jobs.</p><blockquote><p>“The investment in our new penthouse suite is to meet both the increased demand from existing clients but also to accommodate our future expansion. The whole area of customer experience and sales is becoming more complex and companies now recognise that using a specialist third party makes perfect sense, as they often do not have the expertise, capacity or infrastructure in-house.”</p><p>Dino Forte, Managing Director and Founder, Ventrica</p></blockquote><p>According to analyst Forrester European online retail sales are estimated to reach €378 billion by 2021. In a post-Brexit world, Ventrica is ideally positioned to take advantage of this trend due to its vast experience of working in both European and international markets matched by its extensive multi-lingual and omni-channel capabilities.</p><h3>Investment in talent and technology</h3><p><img alt='Ventrica' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/about/PTAIT_20150112_0588_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>As well as investing in a new space, Ventrica has recently acquired 35 new employees who were made redundant due to the closure of Converso Contact Centre also based in Southend-on-Sea. New employees will work across a range of customer service, regulatory and IT roles.</p><p>Ventrica continues to take advantage of the latest IT, having recently upgraded its server base, hardware and virtualised technology. The company is also planning to deploy new recruitment software that enables candidates to take a virtual tour of the centre and undertake improved e-learning and development.</p><blockquote><p>“At Ventrica we focus mainly on customer management and have invested heavily in both our people and environment so we can attract and retain the right calibre of talent to provide exceptional customer service and sales management across multiple channels, time-zones and languages.”</p><p>Dino Forte, Managing Director and Founder, Ventrica</p></blockquote><h3>Accolades and Recognition</h3><p>Over the last few years Ventrica has picked up an array of industry awards including:</p><ul><li><strong>UK CCF Awards 2016 </strong><br/>	Winner – Best Customer Contact Centre, large category</li><li><strong>Direct Commerce Association 2015</strong><br/>	Winner – Best Outsourcing Partnership </li><li><strong>European Contact Centre and Customer Service Awards 2015 </strong><br/>	Silver winner - Best Outsourcing Partnership</li><li><strong>European Contact Centre and Customer Service Awards 2016</strong><br/>	Finalist – Best Outsourcing Partnership and Best Contact Centre</li><li><strong>CCMA Awards 2016</strong><br/>	Finalists - Best Team Manager category </li><li><strong>UK CCF awards 2016</strong><br/>	Finalist - Best Outsourcing Partnership Award  </li></ul><p>The company also holds ISO 9001 accredition and is FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) registered for work within financial services.</p><h3>Essex – ‘The UK’s Back Office’ for financial services businesses</h3><p><a href='http://www.ventrica.co.uk/news/news_content/ventrica-expands-contact-centre-to-330-seats-to-meet-rising-demand-for-its-outsourced-customer-management-services' target='_blank'><img alt="Ventrica's Penthouse Suite" src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/about/Ventrica-new-Penthouse-contact-centre-suite-400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/></a>South Essex is fast emerging as a preferred location for both 'in-house' and outsourced back office functions for finance businesses involved in Business Processing Outsourcing (BPO), Shared Services and Contact Centre operations.</p><p>The London-Essex UK Finance Corridor – extending from the City eastwards into Essex – has attracted leading financial services business seeking to combine reduced costs with fast transport access to London.
