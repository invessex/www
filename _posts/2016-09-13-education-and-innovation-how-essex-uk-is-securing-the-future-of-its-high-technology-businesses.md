<p><img alt='Cambridge-Essex UK High Tech cluster' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/CEUHTC_icon_landscape_600.jpg' style='width: 600px; height: 170px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;'/></p><p><strong>For high technology companies, maintaining a competitive edge requires an innovative approach to education and skills development. In Essex, employers and education providers are working together to show how it’s done.</strong></p><p><img alt='Raytheon' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Raytheon_Diversity_Image_at_Demo_Center_700.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 299px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>From communications systems to medical devices and more, businesses have become increasingly reliant on high technology, demanding new solutions to meet challenges within their sector.</p><p>In order to fulfil this demand, high-technology companies face a challenge: not only to keep developing new innovations, but to keep developing the skills of the people who work for them too, now and for the future.</p><p><a href='http://www.raytheon.co.uk/' target='_blank'>Raytheon</a> – an Essex-based technology and innovation leader specialising in defence, civil government and cybersecurity solutions, has found this to be the case... </p><blockquote><p>“The ability to attract and retain appropriately skilled employees is a strategic imperative to delivering competitive advantage,” <sup>[1]</sup></p><p>Suzanne Jude, Head of Strategy, Raytheon</p></blockquote><p>And, in Essex, it’s a challenge education providers and high-technology businesses are rising to, together.</p><h3>Collaborative training and education…</h3><p>As the high-technology industry bridges multiple market sectors, from defence and aerospace to healthcare and automotive, a collaborative approach to training and education is vital.</p><p>The <a href='http://essexpartnership.org/content/essex-employment-and-skills-board' target='_blank'>Essex Employment and Skills Board (ESB),</a> chaired by Raytheon’s Suzanne Jude, was set up for this purpose, bringing together employers, educators and local government to give Essex ‘a real voice in shaping skills provision.’ <sup>[2]</sup></p><p>But what other educational resources does Essex offer? And how does their provision help high-technology businesses in the county?</p><h3>Specialist technology education provision…</h3><p><img alt='Sir Charles Kao University Technical College' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Sir_Charles_Kao_UTC_Building_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>Essex is home to multiple, high-ranking education establishments that have forged strong links with high-technology industry, including the UK’s first college of advanced technology - <a href='http://www.procat.ac.uk/' target='_blank'>PROCAT</a> (Prospects College of Advanced Technology).</p><p>The <a href='http://www.sircharleskaoutc.com/' target='_blank'>Sir Charles Kao University Technical College</a> in Harlow combines practical, academic education and training linked to the workplace, and has built its curriculum around <a href='http://www.sircharleskaoutc.com/about/specialisms/' target='_blank'>technical specialisms</a> such as Smart Environments and Medical Technology.</p><p>And, through their close links with Essex-based businesses, both colleges offer adult learning opportunities, industry-linked projects, apprenticeships and traineeships, relevant to the needs of local employers such as Raytheon.</p><blockquote><p>“The strength of Essex’s further education providers is that they are responsive to employers.</p><p>Both PROCAT and the Sir Charles Kao UTC put employers at the heart of their delivery. This means taking time to understand what works best and responding accordingly.”</p><p>Suzanne Jude, Head of Strategy, Raytheon</p></blockquote><h3>And high-ranking research universities…</h3><p><img alt='University of Essex ' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Uni_of_essex_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>The region’s higher education providers align their teaching specialisms with the requirements of Essex’s high-technology businesses, too.</p><p>The <a href='http://www.essex.ac.uk/' target='_blank'>University of Essex</a> – a world top 2% ranked university <sup>[3]</sup> – <a href='http://www.essex.ac.uk/study/pg/masters/default.aspx' target='_blank'>offers post-graduate courses</a> in areas including Telecommunication and Information Systems and Cloud Computing, at its School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering.</p><p>The University is also a ‘UK top 20’ university for Research Excellence <sup>[4]</sup>, with specialisms in a range of key high-technology disciplines, such as Big Data, Radio, Radar and Electromagnetics, and Optical and Semiconductor Devices.</p><h3>Skills for success</h3><p>With its collaborative approach to meeting skill requirements, leading educational establishments and proximity to London and Cambridge, Essex means business for high-technology companies such as Raytheon...</p><blockquote><p>“From our experience of working in other parts of the country and internationally, Essex has developed a truly innovative, evidence-based, responsive approach to skills. </p><p>This gives us the confidence that a future workforce is being developed, our needs are understood and that employers have a central role.”</p><p>Suzanne Jude, Head of Strategy, Raytheon</p></blockquote><table cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0'><tbody><tr><td height='80'><table cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='100%'><tbody><tr><td><h3>FIND OUT MORE</h3><p>Contact <a href='../index.html' target='_blank'>INVEST Essex</a> to find out more about the Cambridge-Essex UK High-Technology Cluster.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Sources:</strong><br/>[1] Interview with Suzanne Jude, Raytheon, February 2016<br/>[2] Essex Partnership: Essex Employment and Skills Board: <a href='http://essexpartnership.org/content/essex-employment-and-skills-board'>http://essexpartnership.org/content/essex-employment-and-skills-board</a><br/>[3] Times Higher Education:  <a href='https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2015/reputation-ranking#!/page/0/length/25'>https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2015/reputation-ranking#!/page/0/length/25</a><br/>[4] Times Higher Education: <a href='https://www.timeshighereducation.com/sites/default/files/Attachments/2014/12/17/x/o/z/sub-14-01.pdf'>https://www.timeshighereducation.com/sites/default/files/Attachments/2014/12/17/x/o/z/sub-14-01.pdf</a>) </p>
