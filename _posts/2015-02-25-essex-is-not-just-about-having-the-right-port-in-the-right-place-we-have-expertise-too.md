<p><strong>Electro-mechanical expertise</strong><br/><img alt='' src='//clarity-strategies.github.io/ie-uploads/uploads/blog/WindBlog2_Flaktwoods300px.jpg' style='float:right; height:232px; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px; width:300px'/>The area of Essex around Harwich has a rich heritage of electromechanical work with companies such as Fläkt Woods in Colchester, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of industrial electric fans and a legacy of diesel turbines from the former MAN Paxman factory.<br/><br/><strong>Composite engineering</strong><br/>Composite engineering expertise is a critical success factor for wind turbine blades and nacelles and Essex has a world-leading manufacturer of composite components, IPECO in Southend. Their core business is manufacturing their own products for the aerospace sector, they also undertake contract engineering projects in composites for other companies.<br/><br/>The Ford Dunton Technical Centre near Basildon also has expertise in working with composites in car manufacture and will also allow third parties access to their prototyping / testing equipment.<br/><br/><strong>Skills development</strong><br/>Anglia Ruskin University in Chelmsford have undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in mechanical and civil engineering and postgraduate degrees in electronic and electrical engineering. Although the University of Essex has no engineering faculty its computing department has undertaken research into subsea robotics. <br/><br/><a href='http://www.cwind247.com/what-we-do/training/' target='_blank'>Cwind</a> has also heavily invested in training its own staff in offshore operations &amp; maintenance activity and also trains teams from external companies as well as individuals seeking a career in the offshore installation and maintentance sector.<br/><br/>Colchester Institute offers Higher National Certificates (equivalent to one year of a degree course) or Higher National Diplomas (equivalent to two years) in both Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Power Engineering. These courses are available on both a full and part time basis. It also established the <a href='http://www.colchester.ac.uk/about-us/campuses/energy-skills-centre/' target='_blank'>Energy Skills Centre</a> using a building donated by the port of Harwich.</p><p><strong>Contact</strong><br/>Robert Edge from INVEST Essex will be visiting the European Wind Energy Association conference and exhibition Copenhagen from March 8-10 and would welcome an opportunity to discuss how you can benefit from locating an offshore service or component manufacturing activity in Essex.</p><p><a href='mailto:Robert.Edge@investessex.co.uk'>Robert.Edge@investessex.co.uk</a> / +44 7740 179497<a href='essex-is-not-just-about-having-the-right-port-in-the-right-place-we-have-ex#' style='margin: 0px; border: currentColor; left: 0px; top: 0px; width: 16px; height: 16px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: middle; float: none; display: inline; white-space: nowrap; position: static !important;' title='Call: +44 7740179497'><img src='data:image/png;base64,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' style='border:currentColor; bottom:0px; display:inline; float:none; height:16px; left:0px; margin:0px; overflow:hidden; position:static !important; right:0px; top:0px; vertical-align:middle; white-space:nowrap; width:16px' title='Call: +44 7740179497'/></a><br/> </p>
