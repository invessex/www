<p>The University of Essex is in exploratory discussions to build the world's deepest swimming pool for spaceflight and human endurance research. It will become Europe’s top marine and space research facility.<br/><br/><img alt='Y-40 Deep Joy pool in Padova, Italy' src='http://www.investessex.co.uk/uploads/blog/Divingpoolitaly_300.jpg' style='float:right; height:169px; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px; width:300px'/>The proposed 50m deep pool at the University of Essex in Colchester will be deeper than NASA's own 12m deep training pool in Houston and deeper than the world's current deepest pool, the 42m “Y-40” diving pool in Padova, Italy. It will simulate the microgravity of outer space and deep-sea environments used to train astronauts &amp; deep sea divers.<br/><br/><strong>Strategic location for research and development</strong><br/>The proposed £40m pool would be located at the University of Essex’s <a href='http://www.investessex.co.uk/studies/place-studies/the-university-of-essex-knowledge-gateway/' target='_blank'>Knowledge Gateway</a> research and business park, close to the London-Stansted-Cambridge economic corridor, and within easy reach of the offshore wind industry conducted through <a href='http://www.investessex.co.uk/studies/place-studies/harwich-international-port/' target='_blank'>Harwich</a>, one of the most experienced wind ports in the UK.</p><blockquote><p>'All the ingredients are here; the location near to Stansted Airport and the North Sea offshore industry via Harwich; a superb campus site and an excellent research base within the University's academic departments.'<br/>John Vickers, Managing Director, Blue Abyss</p></blockquote><p><strong>World leading research facility</strong><br/>The team working with Blue Abyss includes Professor Walter Kuehnegger, one of NASA’s Apollo Lunar Exploration Principle Investigators, who has joined as a consultant. Tim Peake, the next European Space Agency astronaut, has also backed the project.</p><blockquote><img alt='World's deepest pool to be built at University of Essex Knowledge Gateway campus' src='http://www.investessex.co.uk/uploads/blog/Uniofessexpool_300.jpg' style='float:right; height:300px; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px; width:300px'/><p>“I support Blue Abyss and see this future facility as something that does not yet exist in Europe and that would compete with, or potentially even surpass, what is available in the United States and Russia.”<br/>Tim Peake, Astronaut, European Space Agency</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“We are now intent on developing links with a number of the world’s highest profile organisations and companies and see this as a key step towards realising our objectives.”<br/>John Vickers, Managing Director, Blue Abyss</p></blockquote><p>The pool will complement the University of Essex’s work in monitoring water quality, marine conservation and data analytics.</p><blockquote><p>“Most people will already know about our work with robotic fish to monitor water quality, but our Human Performance Unit is also based at our Wivenhoe Campus and we have many other specialisms which complement this project including psychology, marine conservation and of course data analytics which underpins all of these areas.<br/>Bryn Morris, Registrar, University of Essex</p></blockquote><p><strong>University investment in growth</strong><br/><img alt='University of Essex new student centre and business school' src='http://www.investessex.co.uk/uploads/blog/Bus_school_1_300.jpg' style='float:right; height:200px; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px; width:300px'/>The University of Essex is currently undergoing its largest expansion in its 50-year history. It is investing in new teaching, research and living facilities and has just opened a new £26m student centre. A £21m business school is due for completion later this year. The proposed pool project would further enhance the University of Essex’s offer.</p><blockquote><p>“Many elements of this project fit very well with our strengths as a university. What also really interests us in this proposal are the business engagement and SME spin-out opportunities that could be generated from this development and we look forward to working alongside Blue Abyss to see how it can be delivered.”<br/>Bryn Morris, Registrar, University of Essex</p></blockquote><p><strong>About the University of Essex Knowledge Gateway</strong><br/>The Knowledge Gateway at the University of Essex is a business community where experts can collaborate, ideas are developed and businesses are enabled to prosper and drive business forward across a range of sectors.<br/><br/>Source [<a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-33606458' target='_blank'>BBC News</a>] [<a href='http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/university_of_essex_puts_forward_plans_for_50m_deep_swimming_pool_1_4163324' target='_blank'>EADT</a>]<br/><br/>See <a href='http://www.investessex.co.uk/studies/place-studies/university-of-essex/' target='_blank'>here</a> for more info on the University of Essex</p>
