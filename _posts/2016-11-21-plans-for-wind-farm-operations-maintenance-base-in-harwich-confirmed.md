A lease has been agreed in principle with Harwich International Port for the O&amp;M base and associated infrastructure.</p><p>The development and construction of Galloper is being led by energy company Innogy SE. The total cost of the project is estimated at £1.5 billion.</p><blockquote><p>“We have recently agreed a lease in principle with Harwich International Port for the Galloper O&amp;M base and are currently pursuing planning permission in relation to this.  Following the redesign of the project in 2015 we considered a number of options in relation to the Operations &amp; Maintenance base and Harwich meets the project’s specific requirements.”</p><p>Toby Edmonds, Project Director, Galloper Wind Farm</p></blockquote><h3>About the Galloper project</h3><p><img alt='Wind Turbines' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>The Galloper Wind Farm is an extension of the existing and fully operational Greater Gabbard Wind Farm off the coast of Suffolk. It was previously thought that Galloper’s developers had selected the Port of Lowestoft as a location for the O&amp;M base. Lowestoft currently houses the offshore construction coordination base for the project and over the next two years, 40 personnel from the Galloper Wind Farm and their contractors will be based at the port while the construction phase of the project is underway.</p><p>The Galloper project will comprise of 56 turbines manufactured by Siemens. Local Essex company CWind won a 2 year contract from Siemens to install and maintain all their UK offshore turbines as well as their first export contracts in the Netherlands and Germany. The wind turbines used at Galloper are 6 megawatts (MW). Each one is nearly twice the size of the 3.6 MW turbines used in Gunfleet Sands Essex’s first windfarm. The electricity generated will cater to the needs of approximately 336,000 households. Commercial production is scheduled to commence in 2018 and is expected to provide clean energy for 25 years.  </p><h3>The Harwich offer</h3><p>Harwich is part of the UK’s largest port complex and is one of the UK’s largest and most experienced port complexes in the offshore renewables industry.
