This is the first phase of a £1bn regeneration project that will transform a brownfield site on the Thames Estuary.</span></p><p>The Purfleet regeneration project, led by regeneration and development specialists Urban Catalyst, will incorporate The Quartermaster Studios, a 600,000sq ft media village featuring several film stages and production suites at its centrepiece. This will be the first purpose-built film and TV studio complex of this type in the UK for 50 years and will create long-term social and economic benefits to the area. The project will also see 2,500 homes built and a redeveloped waterfront that will include retail and leisure facilities.</p><blockquote><p>“We are delighted to be working with Urban Catalyst and, together with the plans for a new creative hub, this project will create major long-term social and economic benefits for the area.”</p><p><br/>Jerome Geoghegan, Group Director of Development and Sales, L&amp;Q</p></blockquote><h3>Positioning Purfleet as an international creative hub</h3><p>The Quartermaster Studios are at the heart of the project’s vision to position Purfleet as an international creative hub which is set to begin in 2017. The film and TV studio complex will not only be in close proximity to the High House Production Park and the Royal Opera House Costume Centre but will benefit from the excellent rail connections to London Fenchurch Street less than half an hour away.</p><p><img alt='Purfleet' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Purfleet__400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 330px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>Thurrock Council has been credited for their approach to the project. By offering their land as a joint-venture partner with Urban Catalyst it maximised the mix of uses and the quality of the development whilst at the same time allowing the council to benefit from the redevelopment of its land.</p><blockquote><p>“We have made connectivity and sustainability at the heart of our plans, and L&amp;Q’s input and experience will be crucial to delivering Purfleet’s regeneration. The support of Thurrock Council as full partners in generating this scheme is creating a new standard in public private partnership.”</p><p><br/>Ken Dytor, Managing Director, Urban Catalyst and Joint Founder, Purfleet Centre Regeneration Limited (PCRL)</p></blockquote><h3>Connectivity of the Thames Estuary</h3><p>Purfleet benefits from a strategic location, at the heart of the Thames Estuary, within easy access of the M25 London orbital motorway which provides businesses with fast road access to London and other main UK cities. As well as high frequency rail freight connections to London Purfleet’s port offers access to both UK and European markets and London’s six airports can be accessed within 1 hour 30 minutes.</p><p>Source [<a href='http://www.constructionenquirer.com/2016/01/18/1bn-purfleet-regeneration-development-deal/'>Construction Enquirer</a>] [<a href='http://www.housingexcellence.co.uk/news/lq-invest-%C2%A327-million-first-phase-purfleet-regeneration-project'>Housing Excellence</a>]</p>
