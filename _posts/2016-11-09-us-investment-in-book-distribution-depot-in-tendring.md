Penguin Random House, 'the world's first truly global trade book' publisher, continues to see the UK as an ideal location for their business.</p><p>Post Brexit Essex is proving to be a location with huge opportunities for businesses and investors alike and the UK remains one of the leading destinations for foreign direct investment (FDI) in Europe. Although the London School of Economics Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) stated that leaving the European Union would reduce flows of FDI into the UK by more than a fifth, damaging productivity and lowering people’s incomes, figures show that almost 1,600 new jobs a week were created by FDI in 2015 to 2016.</p><h3>Expanding premises in Essex</h3><p><img alt='Penguin Random House ' src='//clarity-strategies.github.io/ie-uploads/uploads/blog/_ALS8203_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 299px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/></p><p>A hundred jobs are to be created in Frating, in one of the largest warehouses in Tendring, in an expansion of Penguin’s book distribution depot. New positions to be created during 2017 will be across distribution, customer services, credit services and technology.</p><p>The Book Service (TBS) in Frating will take over the distribution of Penguin and DK titles in 2017/18. TBS distribution centre has been at the Colchester Road site for more than 20 years. It is responsible for distributing books published by the Penguin Random House Group. In addition to book distribution, it is also home to some finance and technology departments. In total, some 600 staff are employed there, with additional seasonal agency staff during busy periods such as the run up to Christmas.</p><blockquote><p> <em>“The Book Service in Frating is key to ensuring that the millions of best sellers published in the UK each year by Penguin Random House are delivered to readers across the county and this expansion will ensure that we continue to meet the demand of our customers and readers”.</em></p><p><em>Spokesperson, Penguin Random House</em></p></blockquote><h3>Distribution depot for UK customers </h3><p>At the end of last year, Penguin Random House announced it would move from three distribution depots to two in Frating and Grantham.

Bestsellers which have been packed and distributed by the Frating depot this year include the worldwide number one by Paula Hawkins, The Girl on a Train, and books by authors such as Lee Child, Jilly Cooper, Bill Bryson and Guy Martin.</p><h3>About Penguin Random House</h3><p>Penguin Random House comprises the adult and children’s fiction and nonfiction print and digital trade book publishing businesses of Penguin and Random House in the U.S, U.K, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and worldwide.
