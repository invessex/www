The new Chemsford store will further strengthen John Lewis’s position in the market.</p><blockquote><p>'This will be John Lewis' first site in Essex and is set to be one of the most modern shops in our portfolio, bringing together the very best of our services.</p><p>Bond Street will play a central role in Chelmsford's future and 2016 is set to be a landmark year for everybody here today. The city matches John Lewis perfectly.”</p><p><br/>Tim Harrison, Director of Store Development, John Lewis</p></blockquote><h3>An unrivalled retail and leisure offer</h3><p>Well known retailers have already taken space within the ‘Bond Street’ development.
