Linking London and Cambridge and with six airports within 90 minutes drive Essex based businesses truly benefit from global connectivity.</p><p>Financial and business advisory firm Grant Thornton who has offices in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East opened their first office in Essex earlier this year. The company’s corporate finance team have just reported a significant upturn in mergers and acquisitions across the county completing four major deals over the past 12 months involving US buyers totalling more than £100m.</p><blockquote><p>“Essex is an ambitious marketplace full of creative businesses looking to succeed and grow. The county is also home to two major airports plus Harwich International Port, the Port of Tilbury and Thames Gateway, and with close proximity to London, the international potential for these companies is huge.</p><p>It’s a great market for transactions right now. Buyers are prepared to offer a premium for quality companies and there is certainly an abundance of these in Essex.”</p><p>Tim Blois, Corporate Finance Director, Grant Thornton</p></blockquote><h3>The London-Essex UK Finance Corridor</h3><p><img alt='Amlin UK new headquarters in Chelmsford, Essex' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/0027_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 266px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>Essex’s proximity to the City of London and Canary Wharf provides businesses with access to a large and diverse financial services workforce, many of whom live in Essex, which competitor UK locations simply can’t match. Leading global insurer AON plc are planning to expand their back office function in Chelmsford, whilst specialist insurer Amlin has recently opened a new £27 million headquarters, to capitalise on the city’s connectivity to London’s global finance hub and accessibility to 688,000 London finance cluster workers.</p><blockquote><p>“We see Essex as a great base because it has a mixture of skills that we need right from our insurance business, core business, to the support functions such as IT, finance, marketing, communications.</p><p>Being close to London we can have a large staff hub out here, the cost advantage, but equally, being a large financial institution, having great connectivity with the city of London.<br/><br/>This is the hub outside London for us, hence why we built and own the building.'</p><p>Travis Bowles, Head of Claims for Property &amp; Casualty, Amlin plc</p></blockquote><h3>Essex is the UK’s multi modal logistics gateway</h3><p><img alt='Essex is the UK's multi modal logistics gateway' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/general/IE_15_MM_Infog_Meta2_600px_72dpi.png' style='width: 400px; height: 795px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>Essex has a strong distribution and port offer with over 1000 acres of available land located near major ports, road and rail. London Gateway Logistics Park, adjacent to London Gateway Port, the UK’s newest deep sea container port, is set to become Europe’s largest logistics park.</p><p>It is currently attracting companies who are taking advantage of the port’s reach to 16 million consumers within 50 miles. UPS is the latest company to announce a move to DP World London Gateway Logistics Park. Other tenants include Import Services and transport firm Eddie Stobart who has just set up a base at the port.</p><blockquote><p>“By using DP World London Gateway Park and Port, UPS will have a fast ‘global conveyor-belt’ directly connected to their own worldwide network. UPS’s hub will also provide distribution solutions to other logistics park occupiers. This combination of world class services will be a unique offering for the UK and Europe.”</p><p>H.E Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Chairman, DP World</p></blockquote><h3>INVEST Essex assisting businesses in Essex with commercial success</h3><p>INVEST Essex offer free professional services to companies in Essex, the UK and abroad to help those companies to maximise the commercial opportunities of a business location on the doorstep of London and Cambridge and with excellent access to Europe.</p><p>INVEST Essex works with a community of commercial partners who enable them to deliver solutions to a range of businesses including those new to Essex, be it from abroad or elsewhere in the UK, as well as many existing companies who are seeking assistance or advice on business growth or improving performance here in Essex.</p><p>For more information on see <a href='../index.html'>http://investessex.co.uk/</a> </p>
