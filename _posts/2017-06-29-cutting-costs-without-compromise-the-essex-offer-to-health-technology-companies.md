**Reduced costs and strategically located specialist sites are attracting health technology companies to Essex.**

Cambridge and London offer everything you’d expect from major technology and business hubs, including high property costs and limited land supply. By establishing operations in the county of Essex – located between the two cities – companies can address both problems, while benefiting from fast access to Cambridge and London.

### Reduced property costs, more expansion space…

To start with savings, health technology companies expanding in Essex can benefit from average property cost that are 33% lower than Cambridge and 46% lower than London. <sup>[1]</sup> With regard to expansion space, Essex offers a range of available property solutions for health technology companies, including Enterprise Zones and Research Parks, offering custom-designed, specialist accommodation for businesses of all sizes.

### Harlow Enterprise Zone: Exemplifying the Essex Advantage

[Harlow Enterprise Zone](http://investessex.co.uk/studies/place-studies/harlow-enterprise-zone) (EZ) exemplifies Essex’s location advantages for health technology companies. Comprising 51 acres of development land, the zone’s prime location offers fast access to the M11 motorway and London Stansted Airport, while enabling access to both Cambridge and London in less than 1 hour. <sup>[2]</sup> <sup>[3]</sup>&nbsp;{% include right-image.html src="//res.cloudinary.com/investessex/image/upload/v1498750357/Harlow_ez_400_hxcraw.jpg" caption="Harlow Enterprise Zone" %}

But the site’s advantages for health technology companies go well beyond cost savings.&nbsp;

### Bespoke properties and Enterprise Zone benefits…

> There are several advantages to choosing an Enterprise Zone, such as the significant business rate discounts offered to companies who commit to operating on the site for a minimum of 5 years.”

Other benefits include simplified planning via a local development order and superfast broadband.

### Diverse high-technology capabilities…

![Raytheon building at Harlow Enterprise Zone](http://www.investessex.co.uk/uploads/about/Raytheon_approved_DSC_6790a_400.jpg)But there’s another Essex advantage for health technology companies that Harlow Enterprise Zone neatly exemplifies. From a technology perspective, Essex is characterised by a unique convergence of competencies, spanning medical devices, pharmaceuticals, advanced electronics and ICT, including ‘big data’ analytics. These capabilities are represented at Harlow EZ by a state-of-the-art data centre and companies, such as [Raytheon](http://investessex.co.uk/studies/case-studies/raytheon-company), that serve diverse high-technology sectors, including healthcare, aerospace and defence. Public Health England (PHE) has also selected the zone as the location for its major new Public Health Science Hub. <sup>[2] [4]</sup>

### Supported by local education and training infrastructure…

The needs of Enterprise Zone companies operating across these high-technology sectors have been recognised by education and skills providers in the Harlow area. The Sir Charles Kao UTC (University Technical College) focuses on technical specialisms in Medical Technology and Smart Environments, working in partnership with organisations including GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson Controls and the Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust.

### Saving Money Without Compromise…

Reducing costs is always good for business. But in Essex, health technology companies are managing to combine property cost savings with a range of value-adding location benefits: fast access to Cambridge and London, specialist science park accommodation, diverse technology strengths and targeted education and skills provision.
