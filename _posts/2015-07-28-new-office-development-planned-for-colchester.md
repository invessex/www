<p><img alt='Birkett Long to move into Sheepen Place Office Development in Colchester' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/B_long_new_premises_300.jpg' style='width: 300px; height: 213px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>Legal and financial advisers <a href='http://www.investessex.co.uk/partners/legal' target='_blank'>Birkett Long</a> are planning to relocate their business to a new office development signposted for Colchester. Birkett Long has already exchanged contracts with Colchester Borough Council for space within the proposed 20,000 sq ft Sheepen Place Office Development.<br/><br/>	Building work on the office development has yet to begin and a planning application is expected to be submitted in late August. Planning consent will also be secured for a further office building in the site's second phase of development.<br/><br/><strong>Growth in the Colchester area</strong><br/>	The Sheepen Place Office Development will be the first substantial new build office building in the Colchester area for many years. The proposed development is on the site of an existing car park and will boost the local economy with the expansion of local firms such as Birkett Long.</p><blockquote><p>		“We are delighted to have Birkett Long, a prestigious and well respected firm of legal and financial advisers, as our new long-term tenant.<br/>		This project shows how the council is becoming more commercially focussed in order to deliver its borough-wide priorities.”<br/>		Mark Cory, Councillor, Portfolio Holder for Resources, Colchester Borough Council</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>		“We employ 180 people across Essex and our firm continues to expand. We are outgrowing our current space in Colchester so we look forward to seeing these plans come to fruition. We are all excited about this project and the future of Birkett Long in Colchester and across Essex.”<br/>		Adrian Livesley, Managing Partner, Birkett Long</p></blockquote><p><strong>The benefits of setting up in Essex</strong><br/>	Essex is already home to more than 70,000 businesses providing a vast range of job opportunities for the local population and is a major economic driver in the East of England. As such it is a superb choice for setting up a European headquarters or UK office, opening up a research and development centre, establishing distribution or service facilities, starting a new business or relocating a growing business.</p><p>	In a recent survey by Homelet, the property rental company, Colchester came third in a choice of locations in the UK for Londoners to move to when leaving the City. The UK’s oldest recorded town has fast rail links to the City, is within easy commuting distance of the capital, and also benefits from having easy access to London Stansted airport.</p><p><strong>INVEST Essex maximising the commercial opportunities of the county</strong><br/>	Birkett Long is a commercial partner of INVEST Essex.
