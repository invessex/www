<p>According to a recent article in the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertyadvice/10041015/County-property-guide-Essex-favourite-haunt-of-commuters.html">Telegraph</a>, Essex is a prime location for commuters. It offers quick access to London, a great selection of property at competitive prices, a vibrant business environment and a fantastic quality of life for all the family.</p><blockquote><p>For Stephen and Suzanne Joynes the only way is Essex. They have just moved from Kingston in Surrey to a five-bedroom house in Chelmsford with views over the fields. It does everything they want it to. It gives them a fast commute into London, good prospects for their toddler Isabella and baby Joshua, and a feeling of calm.&nbsp;Most importantly, they bought it all for &pound;550,000, half what it would have cost in Kingston.</p><p>My wife is closer to her parents in Braintree, we can go for walks in the countryside, and the grammar schools are among the best in the country,&rdquo; says Stephen. &ldquo;Suzanne works for a brokerage in the City and I run an infrastructure security business. It takes us less time to get to London than it did when we were in Kingston.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The place to be is Essex if you work in the City, no question,&rdquo; says the estate agent Paul Beresford, who has 24 offices across the county.</p></blockquote><p>Chelmsford is 31 minutes by <a href="http://investessex.co.uk/locations/road-rail">train</a> from Liverpool Street.</p><p>Far from being just a commuter location Essex has a very strong, sizeable and growing business community and is home to many notable companies;&nbsp;<a href="http://investessex.co.uk/studies/case-studies/bae-systems">BAE Systems</a>, <a href="http://investessex.co.uk/studies/case-studies/ford-1">Ford&#39;s European R&amp;D centre</a>, <a href="http://investessex.co.uk/studies/place-studies/london-gateway-port">London Gateway (the UK&#39;s newest deep sea port and Europe&#39;s largest Logistics park)</a>, <a href="http://investessex.co.uk/studies/place-studies/london-stansted-airport">London Stansted airport,</a> <a href="http://investessex.co.uk/studies/place-studies/london-southend-airport">London Southend airport</a>, Proctor &amp; Gamble, <a href="http://investessex.co.uk/studies/case-studies/e2v-technologies">e2v</a>, <a href="http://investessex.co.uk/studies/case-studies/higgins-group">Higgins Construction</a>, Amlin UK and <a href="http://investessex.co.uk/studies/case-studies/olympus-keymed">Olympus Keymed</a>. As well as being home to an array of established business Essex has a rich heritage in entrepreneurship and innovation.&nbsp; The seeds of innovation sown by the <a href="http://investessex.co.uk/studies/case-studies/birthplace-of-radio">Marconi company</a>, and later <a href="http://investessex.co.uk/studies/case-studies/fibre-optic-invention">Nortel</a>, are still being evidenced - Essex has more self-starting businessmen per square miles than anywhere else in the country.&nbsp;Essex continues to provide a great business environment for companies of all sizes to start up, innovate and grow.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is a kind of honesty. People are inclined to be themselves. There&rsquo;s no pretence. Essex people have often come from East End stock. They are down-to-earth, hard-working, go-getting. It is an undiscovered county really, full of wonderful things.&rdquo;&nbsp;Zoe Napier has worked as an independent estate agent in Essex for 30 years.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://investessex.co.uk/locations/education">Education in Essex</a> is thriving. The list of good schools and university expertise is formidable. There are two grammars in Chelmsford, two in Southend-on-Sea, two in Colchester, and an impressive clutch of specialist schools with a focus on business, including Hassenbrook School and Chelmer Valley High, and private schools, including Felsted and Brentwood. In Chelmsford, Mark Davies of Strutt &amp; Parker has noticed that families are moving from the villages into town because the grammars are keen to take pupils from within a 12-mile radius.&nbsp;Our universities are at the forefront of cutting edge research and knowledge transfer. <a href="http://investessex.co.uk/studies/place-studies/university-of-essex">The University of Essex</a> is the top-ranked UK university for Social Sciences research with a five-star rating. Its Photonics Group has become the leading European research institute for optoelectronics, and the Robot Arena is one of the premier mobile robotics research facilities in the UK. &nbsp;<a href="">Anglia Ruskin University&#39;s</a>, international business school offers undergraduate courses in business, through to postgraduate and professional programmes and carries out extensive research and consultancy.</p><p>(Article sourced from the Telegraph: <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertyadvice/10041015/County-property-guide-Essex-favourite-haunt-of-commuters.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertyadvice/10041015/County-property-guide-Essex-favourite-haunt-of-commuters.html</a>)&nbsp;</p>
