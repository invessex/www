<p>Office design consultants, Spacio, provide a range of services to corporate clients considering restructuring, relocation or the refurbishment of premises. Office refits in their extensive and varied portfolio include, the Whitechapel Art Gallery as well as church, warehouse and listed building conversions.<br/><br/>Established in Chelmsford in 1992, Spacio is strategically positioned to serve clients in London and the home counties. Their design centre, showroom, warehousing facilities and main administration services are all centred in Essex and they are ideally located to provide for the current upsurge in business growth in the county.<br/><br/><strong>From the home of radio to a global cosmetics brand</strong><br/>Most recently, Spacio has worked with Benefit Cosmetics to design their new 20,000sq ft UK headquarters in the Victorian grade 2 listed Marconi Building in Chelmsford.</p><blockquote><p>'Chelmsford has been our base since we brought Benefit over to the UK from San Francisco. When we learned that the iconic Marconi building was available, we were immediately sold! It's now a celebration of its historical past mixed with our quirky, contemporary touches. Many people who worked in the building are still living in Chelmsford and it was important that we did it right!'</p><p>Ian Marshall, Managing Director, Benefit UK</p></blockquote><p><img alt='Spacio designed Benefit Cosmetics new UK headquarters in Chelmsford' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/image-287.jpg' style='float:right; height:211px; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px; width:300px'/></p><p>Having been left to squatters and the elements for over 10 years, restoring the Marconi building to its former glory was a huge project. Spacio spent 8 months on site sympathetically refurbishing the 1912 building taking care to keep all the original features. This included transforming Marconi’s former office, into a miniature museum and guest waiting area.<br/><br/><strong>Business growth in the county</strong><br/>There has been a large increase in demand for office refurbishment in Essex. The city of Chelmsford is proving very popular, due to its close proximity and access to London. This increased demand is reflected in the market value for its property. Demand for office space is outstripping supply as many businesses are choosing to remain or relocate in Essex.<br/><br/>Joining Benefit Cosmetics in choosing Chelmsford as the base for their head office, Amlin, the globally renowned insurers, are currently relocating their headquarters in the city. The retention of two such major businesses is a clear indication to other businesses of the benefits of setting up in Essex.<br/><br/><img alt='Tri Sail Towers at London Stansted where Molton Brown, Associated British Foods &amp; Sectra Ltd will be based' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Tri_sail_towers_300.jpg' style='float:right; height:200px; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px; width:300px'/>There are currently numerous large scale office developments underway across the county. Developments such as the TriSail Towers at London Stansted has already attracted high profile brands such as Molton Brown and Associated British Foods as well as the Swedish based medical IT and communication company Sectra Ltd who have chosen it as the base for their UK headquarters. The thriving catchment area of the growing and increasingly successful London-Stansted-Cambridge economic corridor is also home to Skyline 120 Employment Park and Eastlink, a proposed new 18.5 hectare (45.71 acre) employment park in Braintree, which is currently offering commercial space for completion later this year.<br/><br/>Across the county at the M25 Business Centre in Waltham Abbey, national commercial insurance broker, Arthur J. Gallagher, recently moved one of its London branches to the centre taking advantage of the strategic location which provides quick access to north, east and central London as well as throughout Essex and Hertfordshire.<br/><br/><strong>About the City of Chelmsford</strong></p><ul><li>Chelmsford, the UK’s newest city, is home to the busiest railway station in the East of England with over 7m passengers a year</li><li>It has a thriving economy with over 11,000 businesses and 80,000 jobs contributing £3.4 billion to the national economy</li><li>Guglielmo Marconi was an Italian inventor and electrical engineer, who is often credited as the inventor of radio.
