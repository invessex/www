<p><img alt='Land being sold at former Coryton refinery site now named Thames Enterprise Park ' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Coryton_300.jpg' style='width: 300px; height: 170px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>A 403 acre plot on the former site of the Coryton refinery is currently being cleared whilst the land is up for sale with 100 acres available immediately. The site has been renamed Thames Enterprise Park and is being marketed by commercial property consultants, CBRE.</p><blockquote><p>“Thames Enterprise Park is a very significant strategic site, capable of drawing in a wide range of employment generating uses of all sizes that will make use of the exceptional infrastructure and proximity to key logistics sites. For the investment and development sector this is a rare opportunity to create a large scale, master-planned industrial scheme.”<br/>Paul Farrow, Executive Director of the National Industrial Agency Team</p></blockquote><p><strong>Redevelopment ideal for logistics capabilities</strong><br/>Demolition began in November 2014 and clearance of refinery process units is due to be completed in 2016, with other areas to follow. Cleared land can be released for redevelopment in stages.</p><blockquote><p>“We have cleared the first phase of the land for redevelopment and are now in a position to proceed with sale of the land which offers a highly attractive location for a variety of other industrial uses.”<br/>Chris Brookhouse, Chief Executive of Thames Enterprise Park</p></blockquote><p><strong>Building on the great logistics offer in Essex</strong><br/>The site is currently owned by a joint venture of Vopak, Greenergy and Shell. It is located just to the east of DP World’s London Gateway Port, where a 560 acre area of land is under development which will become Europe’s largest logistics park. This logistics park has been planned to sit directly behind the dockside freight handling facilities and has full multi-modal transport infrastructure.</p><p><strong>DP World London Gateway – the UK's most advanced hub</strong><br/>Located just 25 miles from central London, DP World London Gateway has 16 million consumers within 50 miles enabling ships to enter the UK closer to the key areas of consumption such as London, Birmingham and Manchester. The port benefits from accessibility via sea, road and rail and has also developed innovative technology to ensure it remains open in bad weather.<br/><br/>Source [<a href='http://www.logisticsmanager.com/2015/06/huge-logistics-site-planned-for-coryton/' target='_blank'>Logistics Manager</a>]<br/><br/>See <a href='http://www.investessex.co.uk/studies/place-studies/london-gateway-port/' target='_blank'>here</a> for more information on DP World London Gateway</p>
