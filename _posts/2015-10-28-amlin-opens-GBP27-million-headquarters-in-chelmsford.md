<p><span style='line-height: 1.6;'><img alt='Amlin new head office Chelmsford Essex' src='//clarity-strategies.github.io/ie-uploads/uploads/blog/0027_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 266px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>Specialist insurer Amlin has officially opened their new headquarters in Chelmsford with a £27 million investment in a new five storey building. </span></p><p>The new building will cover 65,000 sq ft and will replace three disused office blocks. These were demolished by building firm ISG who re-used materials from the former buildings for the new office.</p><blockquote><p>'It is a huge investment and they have created a fantastic building here. It will become one of the most iconic buildings in Chelmsford, and we need more of them.'</p><p>Cllr Paul Hutchinson, Mayor of Chelmsford</p></blockquote><h3>Belief in Chelmsford as a business hub</h3><p>The city of Chelmsford is an ideal business location for Amlin, on the doorstep of London and Cambridge and with excellent access to Europe. Amlin’s new UK headquarters benefits from being within close proximity of Chelmsford’s fast railway link to London and London Stansted Airport. Chelmsford is currently the busiest railway station in the east of England with over 8m passengers and London Stansted Airport operates more continental flights than any other European airport.</p><blockquote><p>'It is fantastic for us to have this office in Chelmsford. We are still a FTSE 100 company so we still have to be in London, but we are already out here with offices all around the M25.</p><p>The train line is fantastic as it takes 45 minutes door to door to our office in London, it's brilliant. There is no excuse to not being able to see somebody at head office, with the compromise that you are not within the Square Mile.</p><p>This is the hub outside London for us, hence why we built and own the building.'</p><p>Trevor Bowles, Head of Claims for Property &amp; Casualty, Amlin plc</p></blockquote><h3>Growth potential</h3><p><img alt='Essex home to more than 70,000 businesses' src='//clarity-strategies.github.io/ie-uploads/uploads/blog/Fbec2361_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 268px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>Already one of Chelmsford’s biggest employers, Amlin is looking to double its employees to 700 in the new office space. This will mean that Amlin will become Chelmsford's biggest private sector employers within a few years.</p><p>Essex is already home to more than 70,000 businesses providing a vast range of job opportunities for the local population and is a major economic driver in the East of England. As such it is a superb choice for setting up a European headquarters or UK office, opening up a research and development centre, establishing distribution or service facilities, starting a new business or relocating a growing business.</p><blockquote><p>“While it's great to see new investment into Chelmsford – it's even better to see your existing companies grow.</p><p>It's really positive news that companies like Amlin are continuing to invest in Chelmsford. It shows that there is a good economic future here.'</p><p>Cllr Neil Gulliver, who is a Cabinet Member for Planning and Economic Development, Chelmsford City Council</p></blockquote><h3>New Apprenticeship Scheme for Essex school leavers</h3><div><span style='line-height: 1.6;'>Amlin has strengthened its commitment to nurturing local talent by launching a new pilot apprenticeship scheme for Essex school leavers and has already welcomed its first four apprentices. </span></div><blockquote><div>“The apprenticeship scheme is an ideal way to learn about the insurance business from a practical perspective. We have some great new local talent coming into the business, and we’re delighted to welcome them to Amlin.”</div><div> </div><div>Travis Bowles, Head of Claims for Property and Casualty, Amlin plc</div></blockquote><h3>How INVEST Essex works</h3><p><a href='../index.html' target='_blank'>INVEST Essex</a> offer free professional services to companies in Essex, the UK and abroad to help those companies to maximise the commercial opportunities of a business location on the doorstep of London and Cambridge and with excellent access to Europe.</p><p>Source [<a href='http://www.essexchronicle.co.uk/New-Amlin-building-heart-Chelmsford-opens-doors/story-28056754-detail/story.html#ixzz3pld1R0w5'>Essex Chronicle</a>]</p>
