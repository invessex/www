The objective of the regulations is to prevent serious accidents at sea where a ship’s stability is compromised by wrongly declared cargo weight.</span></p><p>The SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) regulations will come into force July 1<sup>st</sup> 2016 and will require the weighing and certification of cargo being loaded into every shipping container before being delivered to a shipping line/port for loading to a vessel. In addition it will no longer be permitted to assume weight based on previous or standard manufacturing weights.</p><p>Metro Bank Asset Finance in partnership with <a href='../index.html' target='_blank'>INVEST Essex</a> and the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT), invite you to a FREE seminar 25 February 2016 to highlight the new regulations and showcase what it means for you. See <a href='../events/uniform-customs-code-and-solas-seminar' target='_blank'>here</a> for more details and how to book a place.</p><h3>Providing a solution for the new regulations</h3><p><img alt='DP World London Gateway' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Picture1_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 200px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>DP World London Gateway has invested in new equipment which will provide a solution for the new regulations. The port will implement scalable solutions to weigh containers shortly after arrival and provide the Verified Gross Mass (VGM). It will still be possible for shippers to provide a certified VGM through electronic messaging prior to arrival at the port if preferred.</p><blockquote><p>“From our contacts with UK exporters, freight forwarders and shipping lines it is clear that the industry in general is finding it challenging to be ready to provide the VGM of containers and without alternative solutions provided by our container terminals, this could become a significant logistics barrier for UK exports and world trade generally.”</p><p><br/>Ganesh Raj, Senior Vice-President and Managing Director, DP World Europe &amp; Russia</p></blockquote><h3>FREE seminar to highlight the new regulations</h3><p>Metro Bank Asset Finance in partnership with INVEST Essex and the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT), invite you to a FREE seminar 25 February 2016 to highlight the new regulations and showcase what it means for you.</p><h3>Speakers include…</h3><ul><li><img alt='Metro Bank' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Metro_Bank_logo_RGB_72dpi.png' style='line-height: 20.8px; width: 146px; height: 63px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>Metro Bank Asset Finance (speaker to be confirmed) - Metro Bank Asset Finance offer a funding solution to businesses who are looking to purchase capital goods, spreading the cost of assets over their economic life and helping to maximise cash flow.</li><li><h3><img alt='Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT)' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/CILT_RGB.jpg' style='width: 235px; height: 107px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/></h3>	Susan Morley FCILT, Morley Consulting - Before starting her own international trade and Customs training and consulting business, Susan worked in shipping and customs management roles at companies such as BT, O2, Unilever, RTZ and Aspreys and also represents CILT on the HMRC JCCC Customs Change Group.<br/>	 </li><li>Bill Brassington, ETS Consulting - an independent safety and security consultant with over 15 years’ experience in the container industry, including time with P&amp;O Containers and GE SeaCo Services.
