<p><strong><img alt='Servowatch a marine automation company in Heybridge Essex' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/about/Servowatch_KNRM_nh1816_lifeboat_300px.jpg' style='float:right; height:170px; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px; width:300px'/>Ship of the Year Award - the Royal Netherlands Society for Marine Engineering (KNVTS)</strong><br/><br/>The Dutch Sea Rescue Institution have just won an award from KNVTS for one of their lifeboats and have credited Essex marine automation company, Servowatch, with their onboard system playing an integral part in them winning the award. A team from Holland braved rough seas to sail across the North Sea to Heybridge to personally thank the team at Servowatch.</p><blockquote><p>“I really do believe that the high level of automation and systems integration inherent to this the first in a series of next generation SAR 1906 vessels was key to the Nh1816 winning the KNVTS Ship of the Year Award in November. And for that, we have made this special journey across the North Sea to say thank you to Stafford and the Servowatch team for their professionalism and expertise in turning our dreams and visions to tangible reality.”<br/>Roemer Boorgaard, Chief Executive Officer of KNRM, the Royal Netherlands Sea Rescue Institution</p></blockquote><p><strong>Company background</strong><br/><br/>The company, which is based at Heybridge in Essex, has been setting the standard for the industry since 1975 and has grown to more than 60 employees, with a turnover of some £6 million. Head of R&amp;D at Servowatch, Stafford Williams, has been with Servowatch Systems since 1984.</p><blockquote><p>“Stafford and his team’s understanding of our requirement and their ability to design and integrate systems capable of meeting those exacting requirements was truly exceptional.”<br/>Roemer Boorgaard, Chief Executive Officer of KNRM</p></blockquote><p><strong>INVEST Essex &amp; Essex Innovation Programme involvement</strong><br/><br/>4 years ago the Essex Innovation Programme (EIP) supported a bid to the Regional Development Agency and assisted the company with general mentoring support. When the time came for the company to relocate, the Inward Investment team played an integral part in this. INVEST Essex has experience of working with businesses of all sizes and have helped many companies relocate in and to Essex.<br/><br/>In 2013 the company relocated to larger premises in Essex to accommodate the expanding engineering, design and product supply the company provides whilst continuing to benefit from the travel links provided by the county.<br/><br/><strong><img alt='Servowatch marine automation company based in Heybridge, Essex' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/about/Servowatch_KNRM_nh1816_lifeboat_300px_2.jpg' style='float:right; height:200px; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px; width:300px'/>The future</strong><br/><br/>The future of Servowatch looks good with strong financial backing and investment into their products. The market share of maritime surveillance programmes is expected to continue to grow apace and Servowatch’s capability and reputation puts them at the forefront of this burgeoning industry.</p><blockquote><p>“At Servowatch we are extremely fortunate to have some of the most talented system engineers and designers in the country. Stafford and his team were instrumental in designing the advanced Integrated Platform Management System we have installed aboard the KNRM vessel.”<br/>Wayne Ross, Servowatch Systems’ Chief Executive Officer</p></blockquote><p><strong>Essex County Council’s Enterprise Team</strong><br/><br/>A number of programmes are in place to help businesses to grow and to bring new businesses into the county.<br/><br/>• INVEST Essex promote the commercial opportunities of the county to businesses across the globe who could benefit from the county’s strategic location and proximity to London, Cambridge and one of the largest consumer economies in Europe. <br/>• Essex International promotes commercial, educational and cultural two way partnerships between Essex and one of China’s strongest provincial economies, Jiangsu. <br/>• Essex Innovation Programme works with established and early stage companies through a team of highly experienced private sector business professionals and networks and events engaging with business across the county providing assistance and professional development opportunities to help them to grow and increase profitability.<br/>• Essex Enterprise Centres provide supportive business space for companies taking their first step into premises.<br/><br/>Find out more at <a href='http://www.investessex.co.uk'>www.investessex.co.uk</a></p><p>Source [<a href='http://www.maritimejournal.com/news101/industry-news/knrm-says-thank-you?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRojv6XMZKXonjHpfsX%2B6eQvX7Hr08Yy0EZ5VunJEUWy2oQJS9Q%2FcOedCQkZHblFnVQASa2xS7kNoqwE'>Maritime Journal</a>]<br/><br/> </p>
