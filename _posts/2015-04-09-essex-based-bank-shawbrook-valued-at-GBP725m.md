<p><img alt='Shawbrook Bank announces its formal admission on the London Stock Exchange' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/LSE.jpg' style='float:right; height:177px; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px; width:284px'/>Shawbrook Bank has been valued at £725m following its formal admission on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). The initial public offering (IPO) was priced at 290 pence per share and will raise £90m through the sale of 75 million shares.<br/><br/>Shawbrook provides loans to small and medium-sized businesses in the UK and consumers in sectors that are often poorly served by the large high street banks.<br/><br/><strong>A rapidly growing UK specialist bank</strong><br/>The Group operates in five lending divisions – Commercial Mortgages, Asset Finance, Business Credit, Secured Lending and Consumer Lending – and has established a diversified and secured lending and saving business.</p><blockquote><p>“We believe we are well-positioned to achieve long-term sustainable growth and that Shawbrook will become an increasingly well-known name in the specialist world of British banking.”</p><p>Richard Pyman, Chief Executive Officer of Shawbrook</p></blockquote><p><strong>Supporting the economy</strong><br/>Shawbrook Bank prides itself on supporting the UK economy through a business model focused on the provision of sensible lending to over 60,000 small and medium-sized businesses and consumers in the UK.</p><blockquote><p>“Our focus on specialist teams, working in carefully selected markets and with a human approach to decision-making to deliver excellent customer service, has enabled us to develop a clearly differentiated business with impressive returns. In the four years since our foundation, we have built a diversified, well-collateralised and growing book, increasing customer loans by over £900 million to £2.3 billion in the year to 31 December 2014, while achieving an underlying profit before tax of £49.1 million.”</p><p>Richard Pyman, Chief Executive Officer of Shawbrook</p></blockquote><p><strong>Floating on the London Stock Exchange</strong><br/>Virgin Money launched on the LSE in November and rival lender Aldermore Bank was valued at £651m when it floated in early March. Shares in the bank soared 10 per cent almost immediately after being listed. Shawbrook will use the £90m raised from the flotation to boost capital and expand the business.<br/><br/>Source [<a href='https://www.shawbrook.co.uk/' target='_blank'>Shawbrook</a>] [<a href='http://www.mortgagestrategy.co.uk/news-and-features/sectors/products/products-news/shawbrooks-ipo-price-puts-value-at-725m/2020148.article' target='_blank'>Mortgage Strategy</a>]</p>
