<p><img alt='Costa Coffee to open new roastery in Basildon Essex' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Costa_coffee_300.jpg' style='float:right; height:169px; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px; width:300px'/>Costa Coffee, the UK’s most popular chain of coffee shops, has recently announced it will build a new £36m roastery in Essex. Essex was the location of choice for the company’s first roastery outside London.<br/><br/>The roastery will be strategically positioned just 14 miles from the Port of Tilbury and 18 miles from central London. The Port of Tilbury currently receives shipments of coffee beans from South America and the Far East. This position will ensure an efficient supply chain thereby minimising food miles as well as increase roasting capacity.</p><blockquote><p>“We are investing an estimated £36 million in a state of the art new roastery to increase our capacity for future customer demand and to maintain the important traditions that have built Costa to be the success it is today.”<br/>Gennaro Pelliccia, Master of Coffee at Costa</p></blockquote><p><strong>UK hub for Costa and a place for further expansion</strong><br/>The UK is a very strong market for Costa and the hub of their national and international business. Demand is high, Costa recently announced a 17.9% sales growth.<br/><br/>The new roastery will support the company’s UK expansion plans when it opens in 2017. Sales are projected to grow from the current annual £1.4 billion to £2.5 billion by 2020.</p><blockquote><p>“Costa is growing and to meet strong customer demand we need to increase our coffee roasting capacity. Our existing Lambeth site does not have the long-term roasting capacity to cater for our increasing UK and international demand. The solution is to build a second roastery in the London area, which will continue to produce the high quality coffee our customers love in the quantity the business requires.”<br/>Christopher Rogers, Managing Director for Costa</p><p>“When our new roastery opens in 2017, we will have a cutting-edge roastery supplying the best quality, from bean to cup, right here in the UK.”<br/>Gennaro Pelliccia, Master of Coffee at Costa</p></blockquote><p><strong>Industrial real estate development</strong><br/>The site for the new roastery is a former Visteon automotive plant and is being developed for Costa by Prologis, a global leader in industrial real estate.<br/><br/><strong>Boost for the local economy</strong><br/>Costa is the fastest growing coffee shop business in the UK and the second largest coffee shop operator in the world.  Costa’s investment and decision to locate in Essex will boost the local economy and add to the 4,500 jobs expected to be created in the UK by the company in next three years.<br/><br/><strong>Essex - the biggest economy outside London or Manchester</strong><br/>Essex is proving a great location solution to companies wanting to reach a UK market and to be close to London, Europe’s no1 investment location.<br/><br/>Source [<a href='https://www.whitbread.co.uk/media/news-press-releases/Costa-set-to-boost-capacity-to-meet-future-demand.html' target='_blank'>Whitbread</a>]</p>
