The 12,000 sq ft (1115 sq m) centre will be a hub for emerging and established creative/digital businesses, and data driven companies in the financial sector who use strong broadband, as well as a potential opportunity for businesses who may otherwise gravitate to London.</span></p><h3>New business space for broadband hungry clients</h3><p>The Creative Business Centre, at the Old Police Station in St Botolphs Street Colchester, will offer…</p><ul><li>1GB fibre optic broadband connectivity (currently only available in York and Peterborough outside of London)</li><li>44 offices</li><li>Café facilities and an outdoor courtyard space</li><li>Access and support for start-ups with dedicated incubator bursary awards</li></ul><p>The business centre has been developed for businesses in the digital creative sector; digital creatives, digital marketing, fast-growing technology start-ups or those requiring flexible studio space.  The vision is to establish the Creative Business Centre as a key player in Colchester’s emerging creative digital industry and as an attractive alternative to London. Colchester has recently been ranked in the top 20 creative clusters in the UK according to a NESTA report*</p><p>In addition, and with data transfer speed a key factor for finance and IT companies, the site is also anticipated to attract interest from businesses in the financial technology (FinTech) sector.</p><p>Essex is a location of choice for finance IT companies including <a href='http://investessex.co.uk/studies/case-studies/ifds' target='_blank'>IFDS</a>, Cofunds and First Data, partly because it is physically close enough to the City to meet requirements for high data speeds. The county’s unbeaten broadband connectivity enables seamless IT communications, both within businesses and with clients.</p><h3>Joint funding</h3><p><img alt='Creative Business Centre Colchester' src='//clarity-strategies.github.io/ie-uploads/uploads/blog/Colchester-thumb-CDB-9_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 299px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>The Creative Business Centre has been jointly funded by both Essex County Council (ECC) and Colchester Borough Council. The centre will be run by SPACE who are experienced in delivering specialist business support to the creative and technology sectors. This will be SPACE’s first venture outside London and a key part of SPACE’s long term strategy to develop a creative/technologies industries production corridor linking East London with Essex.</p><blockquote><p>“I am delighted to see the appointment of SPACE as operator of the new Creative Business Centre. This significant development takes us another step closer to establishing what will be an exciting hub for businesses in this sector, driving economic growth and creating new jobs for Colchester and the surrounding area.”</p><p><br/>Councillor Kevin Bentley, Essex County Council Cabinet Member for Economic</p></blockquote><p>Prospective tenants for the Colchester Old Police Station can register their interest via <a href='http://www.spacestudios.org.uk/archive-studios/colchester-old-police-station-colchester-essex/' target='_blank'>www.spacestudios.org.uk/archive-studios/colchester-old-police-station-colchester-essex/</a></p><p>Source [<a href='http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/14641149.REVEALED__The_East_London_company_picked_to_run_new_creative_business_centre/' target='_blank'>Essex County Standard</a>]</p><p>*<a href='http://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/the_geography_of_creativity_in_the_uk.pdf' target='_blank'>http://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/the_geography_of_creativity_in_the_uk.pdf</a>   </p>
