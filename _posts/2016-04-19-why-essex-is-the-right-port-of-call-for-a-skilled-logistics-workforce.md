[4]</p><h3>Working in partnership with industry…</h3><p><img alt='South Essex College's £45 Million Thurrock Campus' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/BA98802_042_PW_COLLEGE_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>The benefits for businesses that offer apprenticeships and work closely with further education providers are well documented, with companies reporting increased productivity, improved business performance and fewer skill gaps. [5]</p><p>South Essex College is harnessing these benefits and ensuring its courses meet industry demand by offering apprenticeships in logistics operations and management, allowing students to ‘see the theoretical processes live…at the coalface of logistics’ [3], according to Mark Bentley.</p><p>The work-based Advanced Apprenticeship in Logistics Operations Management, for example, allows students to gain a level three certificate in logistics operations while working 30-hours-per-week in the industry.</p><p>For employers in the area, this means that a continuous stream of skilled, cost-effective workers is available, helping businesses to develop the specialist skills required to ‘keep pace with the latest technology and working practices’ [6] in the sector.</p><h3>A gateway to success…</h3><p>Hailed as a ‘game changer’ [7] there’s no doubt the London Gateway development has helped to put Essex firmly on the map, and redefined the future of the UK’s port and logistics industry. With its state-of-the-art infrastructure, proximity to London and excellent nationwide road and rail connections, the site, in combination with Essex’s wider ports and logistics infrastructure, is establish the county firmly as a major hub for international trade. [8]</p><p>Essex’s commitment to working with businesses and developing the skills required by the port and logistics sector only enhances these benefits even further, futureproofing the industry and putting the county on the map as an unrivalled port of call for investment.</p><h3>FIND OUT MORE</h3><p>Contact <a href='../index.html' target='_blank'>INVEST Essex</a> to find out more about the advantages of UK Multimodal Gateway: Essex for your logistics or distribution operation.</p><p><strong>Sources:</strong></p><p>[1] London Gateway Visualisation Video - <a href='http://www.londongateway.com/media-page/videos/'>http://www.londongateway.com/media-page/videos/</a><a href='http://www.londongateway.com/media-page/videos/' target='_blank'> </a> <br/>[2] <a href='http://www.londongateway.com/media-page/press-releases/mayor-london-backs-london-gateway-global-trade-hub-regional-job-creator/'>http://www.londongateway.com/media-page/press-releases/mayor-london-backs-london-gateway-global-trade-hub-regional-job-creator/</a><a href='http://www.londongateway.com/media-page/press-releases/mayor-london-backs-london-gateway-global-trade-hub-regional-job-creator/' target='_blank'>  </a><br/>[3] Mark Bentley ‘About the Course’ video - <a href='http://www.southessex.ac.uk/course/business-logistics-and-supply-chain-level-3-diploma' target='_blank'>http://www.southessex.ac.uk/course/business-logistics-and-supply-chain-level-3-diploma</a>  <br/>[4] Global Supply Chain and Operations Management – Course description: <a href='https://www.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=BE275&amp;level=7&amp;period=AU' target='_blank'>https://www.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=BE275&amp;level=7&amp;period=AU</a><br/>[5] <a href='https://www.learndirect.com/business/products-and-services/apprenticeships/what-are-the-benefits-of-apprenticeships-to-your-business/'>https://www.learndirect.com/business/products-and-services/apprenticeships/what-are-the-benefits-of-apprenticeships-to-your-business/</a><a href='https://www.learndirect.com/business/products-and-services/apprenticeships/what-are-the-benefits-of-apprenticeships-to-your-business/' target='_blank'>  </a><br/>[6] What are the business benefits? -<a href='http://http://www.southessex.ac.uk/course/advanced-apprenticeship-logistics-operations-management-level-3-diploma' target='_blank'> </a><a href='http://www.southessex.ac.uk/course/advanced-apprenticeship-logistics-operations-management-level-3-diploma'>http://www.southessex.ac.uk/course/advanced-apprenticeship-logistics-operations-management-level-3-diploma</a><br/>[7] The Game Changer – London Gateway Logistics Park: <a href='http://http://www.londongateway.com/media/cms_page_media/36/The%20Game%20Changer.pdf' target='_blank'> </a><a href='http://www.londongateway.com/media/cms_page_media/36/The%20Game%20Changer.pdf'>http://www.londongateway.com/media/cms_page_media/36/The%20Game%20Changer.pdf</a><a href='http://http://www.londongateway.com/media/cms_page_media/36/The%20Game%20Changer.pdf' target='_blank'>  </a><br/>[8] <a href='http://www.londongateway.com/the-port/' target='_blank'>http://www.londongateway.com/the-port/</a></p>
