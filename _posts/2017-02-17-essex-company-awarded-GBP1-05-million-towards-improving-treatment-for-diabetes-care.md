Arecor Ltd, a leading biopharmaceutical company, has been awarded £1.05 million towards its development of a ready to use glucagon pen for diabetic patients. The funding will support continued preclinical development of Arecor’s proprietary stable liquid glucagon that will replace glucagon powder and speed up the treatment process for diabetic patients with hypoglycaemia.
