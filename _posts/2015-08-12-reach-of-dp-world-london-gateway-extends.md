<p>A new trade lane is to begin calling at DP World London Gateway Port extending the reach of the UK’s newest deep-sea terminal. The Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) S.A Australia Express Service will be the fastest direct service between Northern Europe and Australia.<br/><br/><img alt='DP World London Gateway MSC S A Australia Express Service' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/msc_roberta_300.jpg' style='float:right; height:150px; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px; width:300px'/>The service will enhance the current provision available for UK importers and exporters as well as offer some of the most competitive routes to the UK from Australia and Sri Lanka.<br/> </p><blockquote><p>“This is further evidence of just how compelling the proposition is at DP World London Gateway Port and Logistics Park. With excellent road, rail and sea access just 25 miles from central London, the use of cutting-edge port technology is both streamlining and bringing previously unmatched integrity and reliability to UK supply chains.”<br/>His Excellency Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Chairman, DP World</p></blockquote><p><strong>Companies moving to what will be the UK’s largest logistics hub</strong><br/>The announcement by MSC follows the opening of container provider Pentalver’s permanent new five-acre depot at the port. The port’s port-centric distribution offer was further boosted this week by the news that the world’s largest courier company, UPS, has submitted plans to build a 180,000sq ft distribution facility at the port’s logistics centre.<br/><br/>DP World London Gateway Logistics Centre is located just to the east of DP World’s London Gateway Port, where a 560 acre area of land is under development including a 300,000sq ft logistics warehouse in a joint venture with international real estate developer Prologis.<br/><br/><strong>Port centric distribution</strong><br/><img alt='DP World London Gateway Logistics Centre' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Logistics_DP_World.jpg' style='float:right; height:216px; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px; width:300px'/>What will become Europe’s largest logistics park has been planned to sit directly behind the dockside freight handling facilities and has full multi-modal transport infrastructure. Last week John Good Shipping announced it had relocated its operations to the centre to be closer to its customers as well as enabling the company to offer an enhanced range of facilities and increase its freight forwarding services.</p><blockquote><p>“Two weeks ago, I had the pleasure of officially opening the London Gateway Logistics Centre and I am pleased to announce that the building is already eighty percent full. This is great news as we have plans to expand and we are now talking to potential clients of phase two of the development.”<br/>His Excellency Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Chairman, DP World</p></blockquote><p><strong>DP World London Gateway – the UK's most advanced hub</strong><br/>Located just 25 miles from central London, DP World London Gateway has 16 million consumers within 50 miles enabling ships to enter the UK closer to the key areas of consumption such as London, Birmingham and Manchester. The port benefits from accessibility via sea, road and rail and has also developed innovative technology to ensure it remains open in bad weather.<br/><br/>See <a href='http://www.investessex.co.uk/studies/place-studies/london-gateway-port/' target='_blank'>here</a> for more information on DP World London Gateway.<br/> </p><div class='chart-container' style='display: none;'><iframe class='essexchart' frameborder='0' height='1000px' src='https://essexcharts.appspot.com/essex1.html' width='100%'></iframe></div>
