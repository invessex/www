The 344,000 sq ft facility will be one of UPS’s largest investments outside the US.</span></p><p>The news is an indication of the courier giant’s confidence in the UK economy. Coming quickly after announcements that US companies Raytheon and Arrow Electronics are to relocate operations in the county this is the latest confirmation that Essex is a prime location for international companies.</p><blockquote><p>“This construction reaffirms UPS’s commitment to the UK and our confidence in its economy. It is part of our nearly $2 billion in infrastructure investments across Europe over the next five years.”</p><p>Luis Arriaga, Managing Director for UK, Ireland &amp; Nordics, UPS</p></blockquote><h3>UK hub and distribution centre</h3><p>UPS’s distribution hub at the London Gateway Logistics Park, expected to be completed in the summer of 2017, will act as a UK hub and distribution centre and a key gateway to UPS’s global transportation network. Once completed, the facility will be able to process approximately 30,000 packages per hour, with room for further expansion.</p><blockquote><p>“By using DP World London Gateway Park and Port, UPS will have a fast ‘global conveyor-belt’ directly connected to their own worldwide network. UPS’s hub will also provide distribution solutions to other logistics park occupiers. This combination of world class services will be a unique offering for the UK and Europe.”</p><p>H.E Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Chairman, DP World</p></blockquote><h3>Europe’s largest logistics park</h3><p><img alt='London Gateway Logistics Centre' src='../uploads/blog/LGW_Logistics_centre_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 267px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>London Gateway Logistics Park, located within 2 miles of London Gateway Port, the UK’s newest deep sea container port, is set to become Europe’s largest logistics park. The logistics park has been planned to sit directly behind the dockside freight handling facilities and has full multi-modal transport infrastructure.</p><p>It is currently attracting companies who are taking advantage of the port’s reach to 16 million consumers within 50 miles.
