This additional funding has supported our strategic plan for growth and shows a genuine commitment on behalf of the UK Government to support manufacturing and sustainable high-level job creation in the UK.”</p><p>Matt Perkins, President of e2v Space Imaging</p></blockquote><p><strong>Space imaging development</strong><br/>e2v have already had their equipment on board over 150 space missions by the world’s largest space agencies, including NASA. The latest investment has built on e2v’s established position as the leading manufacturer of imaging devices for space exploration and earth observation.<br/><br/><img alt='27 of e2v's sensors onboard NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/rsz_satelliteapproachingpluto.jpg' style='float:right; height:214px; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px; width:300px'/>27 of the sensors on board NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft currently on course to fly past the dwarf planet Pluto in July, are provided by the Chelmsford based company.<br/><br/>After more than nine years in space, New Horizons is travelling at nearly 33,000 miles per hour, and its journey from Earth to Pluto has covered almost 32 AU — about 3 billion miles. The spacecraft is now closer to Pluto than the Earth is to the Sun.<br/><br/><strong>e2v’s long history with space</strong><br/>e2v’s expertise has resulted in 30 years involvement with some of the highest profile space science projects, including being the eyes for NASA’s Hubble space telescope, providing the largest sensor array for ESA’s GAIA mission to map the Milky Way and work for the Russian-led World Space Observatory.<br/><br/><strong>About the Regional Growth Fund</strong><br/>Launched in 2010, the RGF is a £2.4bn fund that stimulates enterprise across the country by providing grants to projects and programmes with significant potential for economic growth, leveraging in private sector investment and creating or safeguarding jobs.<br/><br/>Source [<a href='http://www.e2v.com/news/regional-growth-funding-aids-in-the-success-of-e2vs-space-imaging-division/' target='_blank'>e2v</a>]<br/><br/>See here for more information on <a href='http://www.investessex.co.uk/studies/case-studies/e2v-technologies/' target='_blank'>e2v</a></p>
