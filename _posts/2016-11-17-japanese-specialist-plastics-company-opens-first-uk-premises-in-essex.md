The company specialises in micro-engineered products for life sciences such as ‘lab on a chip’ (LOC) a device that integrates laboratory functions on a single chip of only millimetres to a few square centimetres in size.</p><p>Future plans for their work at their facility in Chesterford include developing products in microfluidic arrays (analysis of fluids in volumes up to a billionth of a litre) with particular reference to cancer research and immunotherapy. The accessibility to organisations in this field in the London-Stansted-Cambridge corridor was another reason for the company choosing Chesterford.</p><blockquote><p>'Existing Park occupiers were also a significant attraction to us.  Our model is very much a collaborative one and we hope to build mutually beneficial relationships with fellow life science organisations at the Park as we develop and grow.”</p><p><br/>Jim Ballesty, General Manager, Enplas</p></blockquote><h3>Opening their first UK facility</h3><p>Enplas worked with <a href='../index.html' target='_blank'>INVEST Essex</a> to find a suitable premises in the UK; a 1600sq ft (149sq m) facility incorporating an office and a research and development (R&amp;D) space. This is the company’s only R&amp;D facility outside Japan.</p><p>Enplas were keen to find a location that could accommodate expansion and be in close proximity to the genomics (customising medical care to the body's unique genetic makeup) research taking place at Cambridge. INVEST Essex identified the Chesterford Research Park in the London-Stansted-Cambridge corridor and Enplas chose this location as...</p><ul><li>The company’s research collaborators will initially be UK and predominantly Cambridge-based</li><li>It is close to the Cambridge medical technology cluster, Anglia Ruskin University Business Innovation Centre for Medical and Advanced Engineering (MedBic) in Chelmsford and Public Health England (when they move to their new facility in Harlow)</li><li>It offers excellent access to London and strong connections to the rest of the UK and Europe</li></ul><blockquote><p>“We are uniquely positioned to enable and facilitate large projects, bringing together the microfluidics value chain from the inception of an idea through to clinical trials and eventually on to usage with the end customer. Our objective through the Cambridge Enplas Life Science Laboratory is to actively engage with the life science community to ascertain their requirements, encourage and help facilitate collaborative projects on a joint venture, investment or self-funded basis.”</p><p><br/>Dr Ashok Sinha, Business Development Manager, Enplas</p></blockquote><h3>Working with INVEST Essex and Uttlesford District Council</h3><p><img alt='Chesterford Research Park' src='http://www.investessex.co.uk/uploads/about/Chesterford_RP_1_700.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>INVEST Essex introduced the company to Uttlesford District Council who were able to provide support to the company with their <a href='business-development-rate-relief-scheme#.V63m1VsrLIU' target='_blank'>Business Development Rate Relief Scheme</a>.</p><p>INVEST Essex also introduced Enplas to the Business Angels initiative via Essex County Council’s <a href='http://essexinnovation.co.uk/' target='_blank'>Essex Innovation Programme</a>.</p><blockquote><p>“Uttlesford is delighted to welcome Enplas to the district and to the world class Chesterford Research Park. We created the innovative Business Development Rate Relief Scheme to make the district even more attractive to companies looking for the right location for their business.</p><p>We will continue to work proactively to encourage new businesses in what is a highly competitive marketplace for inward investment.”</p><p><br/>Cllr Julie Redfern, Cabinet Member, Uttlesford District Council</p></blockquote><p>Enplas currently has plans to relocate staff from Japan once the laboratory at Chesterford is fully operational and will recruit more local employees. INVEST Essex has already introduced Enplas to social and cultural Japanese organisations and will continue to support Enplas as the company expands.</p><h3>Taking medical business innovation to market</h3><p><img alt='The MedBIC' src='http://www.investessex.co.uk/uploads/about/The_MedBIC400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>The UK MedTech market has an estimated value of £15 billion and has the largest life sciences cluster outside the US.
