Essex is a key logistics location due to its close proximity to London and access to market via sea, road and rail. These supply logistics play a key role in:</p><ul><li>		Creating an efficient supply chain</li><li>		Contributing towards minimising food/product miles</li><li>		Reduction in costs, waste and carbon footprint</li></ul><blockquote><p>		“The new purpose built site is a significant investment into our business’ future growth. The branch will hold an extensive breadth and depth of product to service all our customers’ needs. It is located near to major roads links, which means we are ideally placed to offer even faster delivery, particularly to London sites, and unrivalled customer service.”<br/>		Andy Wighton, Managing Director of Pipe Center and Climate Center</p></blockquote><p><strong>South Essex logistics offer</strong><br/>	A logistics location in Essex enables cost effective direct distribution of imported cargo to reach almost 50% of the UK’s GDP and 35% of its population within 2.5 hours’ drive by truck.</p><p>	Home to two of the closest ports to London; the Port of Tilbury and DP World London Gateway, the areas around these ports are now the focus for some of Europe’s largest growth regeneration projects including Europe's largest logistics park.<br/><br/>	Source [<a href='http://www.stoford.com/2015/08/wolseley-uk-buys-5-million-basildon-base/' target='_blank'>Stoford]</a> [<a href='http://www.shdlogistics.com/news/wolseley-uk-buys-5m-basildon-base' target='_blank'>SHD Logistics</a>]</p>
