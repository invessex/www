The newly installed dark fibre in Colchester Town Centre network will allow local businesses to compete at a local, national and global level and positions Colchester as an attractive alternative to London.</p><blockquote><p>“We are delighted to be involved in providing an entirely new and highly innovative ultra-fast fibre network. It is great news for the town and will enable local businesses to truly compete at a local, national and even global level. The difference this type of connectivity can make should not be underestimated and we look forward to helping local businesses thrive in the digital age as a direct result of this project”.</p><p>Lloyd Felton, Managing Director, County Broadband</p></blockquote><h3>Colchester at the cutting edge of technological development</h3><p><img alt='Ultra fibre broadband' src='http://www.investessex.co.uk/uploads/about/UFBB_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>The ultra-high-speed broadband connectivity is a significant opportunity for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Colchester to benefit from the improved telecommunications infrastructure. The network will also be of significant benefit to the town’s flourishing digital and creative sector, data driven companies in the financial sector who use strong broadband, as well as a potential opportunity for businesses who may otherwise gravitate to London.</p><p>Essex is a location of choice for finance IT companies including IFDS, Cofunds and First Data, partly because it is physically close enough to the City to meet requirements for high data speeds. The county’s unbeaten broadband connectivity enables seamless IT communications, both within businesses and with clients.</p><blockquote><p>“I am delighted that the Council has taken the lead in providing ultra-high-speed connectivity for the town. This is a very significant and exciting development for the borough. This ultra-high speed connectivity will put the town at the cutting edge of technological development. This is particularly important for digital and creative businesses. This is a major boost for the town’s business environment”.</p><p>Mark Cory, Councillor, Portfolio Holder for Resource</p></blockquote><h3>About the broadband project</h3><p><img alt='Colchester Creative Business Centre' src='http://www.investessex.co.uk/uploads/about/Tps_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 299px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>The innovative broadband project will create the new fibre network, delivering significant cost benefits at the same time. It is the first project of its type in the UK, although the model has been successfully deployed in Scandinavia.  </p><p>In the first phase, the network will pass some 850 businesses, a key focal point to include the forthcoming new £2.6m <a href='new-business-space-with-unrivalled-ultrafast-broadband-connectivity#.WEqZktKLSM8' target='_blank'>Creative Business Centre</a>. It will provide up to gigabit symmetrical connectivity, 30-50 times faster than most town centre businesses can currently receive. The network infrastructure is available to all service providers to deliver connectivity solutions, including broadband and VOIP (voice over IP) to businesses.</p><h3>INVEST Essex assisting businesses in Essex</h3><p>INVEST Essex promotes Essex as a prime UK business solution location to international and UK companies.
