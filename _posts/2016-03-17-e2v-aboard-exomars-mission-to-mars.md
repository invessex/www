The TGO carries the Nadir and Occultation for Mars Discovery (NOMAD), an optical spectrometer equipped with high performance sensors designed and supplied by e2v.</p><p>The power of these sensors means that NOMAD is three times more accurate than previous orbit and ground based instruments sent to study Mars. The TGO will circle Mars for approximately six years, the mission’s lifetime, during which time NOMAD will measure solar radiation travelling through the martian atmosphere at UV and visible wavelengths, in order to detect and map the presence of ozone, dust and ice clouds in the atmosphere of Mars in unprecedented detail.</p><h3>Enabling scientists to study Mars and the atmosphere</h3><p>e2v’s Centre for Electronic Imaging (CEI), which focuses on the development of imaging sensors for space applications, worked with the Open University (OU) to provide Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs) for use in NOMAD to convert light to electrons. The OU chose to work with e2v due to its long expertise in providing science quality CCD technology for space missions.</p><blockquote><p>“In partnership with our customers, our contribution to NOMAD successfully combined our technological expertise in bespoke imaging sensor solutions with CEI’s significant testing experience and instrument development. We’re proud that our space imaging solution will help support scientists discover more about life on Mars.”</p><p><br/>Christophe Tatard, Vice President in Space Imaging, e2v</p></blockquote><h3>e2v world leaders in space imaging</h3><p><img alt='New Horizons fly by of Pluto' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/about/New-Horizons-Fly-by-of-Pluto_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>e2v’s expertise has resulted in 30 years involvement with some of the highest profile space science projects and has provided technology for more than 150 space missions including mapping the Milky Way and work for the Russian-led World Space Observatory.</p><p>In 2009 e2v’s imaging sensors were sent into space by NASA to upgrade and repair the Hubble Space Telescope.</p><p>See <a href='http://www.investessex.co.uk/studies/case-studies/e2v-technologies/' target='_blank'>here</a> for more information on e2v.</p><p>Source [<a href='http://exploration.esa.int/mars/46048-programme-overview/'>European Space Agency</a>] [<a href='http://www.e2v.com/news/e2v-aboard-exomars-trace-gas-orbiter-mission-to-mars/'>e2v</a>]</p>
