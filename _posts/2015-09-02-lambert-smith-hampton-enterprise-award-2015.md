As food for thought, you might want to consider the following:<br/><br/><strong>How could wider local powers support job creation and sustainable growth?</strong></p><ul><li>		Could more local power help support regeneration initiatives?</li><li>		How could devolution support economic growth in your area?</li><li>		How could devolution support investment in infrastructure?</li><li>		How can local autonomy deliver new roads, rail links, bridges and communications infrastructure that support high-quality jobs?</li></ul><p><strong>What might this mean for the future funding of local public services? How could greater local autonomy ease pressure on local housing markets?</strong></p><ul><li>		How could a more powerful local authority unlock new development sites?</li><li>		What should be done to encourage more housebuilding in the public and private sectors?</li></ul><p><strong>Competition details</strong></p><ul><li>		Entry deadline 30 September 2015</li><li>		Shortlist announced October 2015</li><li>		Winners announced November 2015</li><li>		The most enterprising entry will receive £15,000</li></ul><p>	See <a href='http://www.lsh.co.uk/EnterpriseAward' target='_blank'>here</a> for more information on the awards.</p>
