According to recent data from LSH, take up of logistics space (property, sq ft) grew by 17% between 2013 and 2014, and evidence suggests that 2015 will be ‘another good year’.</p><p>The challenge now will be to provide UK logistics businesses with the expansion space they need. According to the same report, the UK’s available stock of logistics space declined by 29% during the same 2013-14 period. [1]</p><h3>Space for expanding UK logistics and distribution businesses…</h3><p><img alt='DP World London Gateway' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Logistics__700.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 229px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>A shortage of available land for logistics operations, resulting from planning regulations and local objections to building on ‘green field’ sites, is a chronic problem at many of the UK’s major logistics locations - both port-adjacent and inland [2].</p><p>This is an area in which the county of Essex possesses a significant competitive advantage as a UK logistics hub. The existence of large-scale, former industrial sites in strategic port-adjacent locations means that Essex can currently offer more than 1,000 acres of land for logistics development.</p><p>These key sites benefit from tri-modal (sea, rail and road) transport connectivity, and include substantial acreages that are ‘ready to go’ for immediate development. Furthermore, Essex is now seeing the speculative development of large-scale units or logistics and distribution, with Prologis and DP World investing in more than <a href='http://www.londongateway.com/media/cms_page_media/38/20750_DPWorld_London_Gateway_JV_Insert_LR_1.pdf' target='_blank'>300,000 sq ft of speculative space</a> at London Gateway Logistics Park.</p><h3>More than 1,000 acres of portcentric, tri-modal logistics sites…</h3><p>Sites and properties are available for logistics and distribution uses across the county of Essex. The following is a summary of the county’s major, strategic logistics development sites, each benefiting from port-adjacent locations and tri-modal transport connectivity:</p><p><strong>London Gateway Logistics Park, Thurrock, Essex UK</strong></p><p><img alt='London Gateway Logistics Park' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Logistics_Park_2_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 299px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;'/></p><p><strong style='line-height: 1.6;'>Port Adjacent:</strong><span style='line-height: 1.6;'> London Gateway</span><br/><strong style='line-height: 1.6;'>Multimodal:</strong><span style='line-height: 1.6;'> Tri-modal - sea, rail, road</span><br/><strong style='line-height: 1.6;'>Unit Sizes:</strong><span style='line-height: 1.6;'> Up to 1 million+ sq ft</span><br/><strong style='line-height: 1.6;'>Available land:</strong><span style='line-height: 1.6;'> 560 acres/9 million sq ft</span><br/><strong style='line-height: 1.6;'>Deliverability:</strong><span style='line-height: 1.6;'> Planning in place</span><br/> </p><p><strong>London Distribution Park, Tilbury, Essex UK</strong></p><p><img alt='London Distribution Park' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/LondonDistPk_Tilbury_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 299px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: '/></p><p><strong style='line-height: 1.6;'>Port Adjacent:</strong><span style='line-height: 1.6;'> Tilbury</span><br/><strong style='line-height: 1.6;'>Multimodal:</strong><span style='line-height: 1.6;'> Tri-modal - sea, rail, road</span><br/><strong style='line-height: 1.6;'>Unit Sizes:</strong><span style='line-height: 1.6;'> 70k-670k sq ft</span><br/><strong style='line-height: 1.6;'>Available land:</strong><span style='line-height: 1.6;'> 70 acres/900k sq ft</span><br/><strong style='line-height: 1.6;'>Deliverability:</strong><span style='line-height: 1.6;'> Infrastructure in place - 'ready to go'</span><br/> </p><p><strong>Thames Enterprise Park, Thurrock, Essex UK</strong></p><p><img alt='Thames Enterprise Park' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Thames_Enterprise_Park_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 299px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;'/></p><p><strong style='line-height: 1.6;'>Port Adjacent:</strong><span style='line-height: 1.6;'> London Gateway</span><br/><strong style='line-height: 1.6;'>Multimodal:</strong><span style='line-height: 1.6;'> Tri-modal - sea, rail (sidings on site), road</span><br/><strong style='line-height: 1.6;'>Available land:</strong><span style='line-height: 1.6;'> Up to 400 acres</span><br/><strong style='line-height: 1.6;'>Deliverability:</strong><span style='line-height: 1.6;'> Available for redevelopment</span></p><h3>Find out more</h3><p>Contact <a href='http://www.investessex.co.uk/' target='_blank'>INVEST Essex</a> to find out more about sites, people and support for your expanding logistics business in Essex, UK.</p><p><strong>Sources:</strong><br/>[1] Lambert Smith Hampton: ‘Industrial and Logistics Market 2015’<br/>[2] e.g. see LSE: Links Between Planning and Economic Performance, 2012</p>
