This is the first phase of a programme which will create 200,000 square feet of grade A office space.</p><blockquote><p>“This will pave the way for the creation of hundreds of new jobs on this site alone and provide the impetus for the development of the remainder of the Enterprise Zone at London Road. We expect very shortly to be able to announce further investment by companies bringing their business to Harlow and 2015 will be an exciting year for the Enterprise Zone.”<br/>John Keddie, Chairman of the Harlow Enterprise Zone Board</p></blockquote><p><strong>Demolition making way for new development</strong><br/>Kao Park, formerly the home of Nortel Telecommunications, will build upon the site’s heritage of being at the forefront of new technology dating back to when fibre optic cable was developed there in the 1960’s. The site is named after Nobel Prize winning scientist Sir Charles Kao who developed the fibre optic technology.<br/><br/>Infrastructure works have been taking place since the beginning of 2015 to enable the development of four data centres with the demolition of old buildings completed in July. Two remaining buildings have been refurbished whilst a new access road is also being constructed to provide a dedicated access for the new business park.</p><blockquote><p>“This year has seen a real acceleration in progress to start bringing the Enterprise Zone to life so I am delighted that work is ready to begin to transform this iconic site.”<br/>Councillor Jon Clempner, Leader of Harlow Council</p></blockquote><p><strong>How the development is assisting the local economy</strong><br/>The owners of the 35 acre site have appointed advisory firm Goldacre Ventures and Harlow-based civil engineering company, Pryor, as the main contractor.<br/><br/>The Kao Park development will occupy the southern sector of the Enterprise Zone with a further 35 acre northern sector being developed by Harlow Council for Med Tech, Life Science and information and communications technology (ICT) opportunities.</p><blockquote><p>“Kao Park is a unique opportunity to leverage a legacy of cutting edge technology to develop a highly connected and secure, state of the art data centre campus that will attract and service a broad range of tenants for the Enterprise Zone.”<br/>David Bloom, Chief Executive, Goldacre Ventures</p></blockquote><p>Announcements confirming the new tenants in Kao Park are expected in September with further announcements about the development of the wider Harlow Enterprise Zone to follow.<br/><br/>Source [<a href='http://harlowez.org.uk/?p=875' target='_blank'>Harlow Enterprise Zone</a>]</p>
