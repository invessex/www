<p><img alt='FlipPad medical product innovation from FutureNova' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/heatrenurseflippad_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>Medical product innovators, FutureNova, have recently launched their medical grade iPad case, the FlipPad™, to help protect medical practitioners and patients from the risk of healthcare associated infections (HCAI) such as Norovirus and C-Difficile.</p><p>This comes at a time when the NHS is looking to cut costs, improve patient care and embrace mobile technology. Approximately 300,000 patients are affected by HCAI every year with an estimated cost to the NHS of £1 billion. The government are requiring the NHS to find £22bn of efficiency savings over the next five years.</p><blockquote><p>“As the NHS introduces new technology into clinical settings to improve care, there is a real risk for infections to be passed between patients, staff and visitors. With this in mind, we created the FlipPad™ where every aspect of the product has been chosen to ensure it can be easily and safely cleaned with standard infection control sprays to reach the highest hygiene standards. Our team is focused on innovating quality products to support the NHS with patient safety initiatives.”</p><p><br/>Mike Casey, (former NHS director) CEO, FutureNova</p></blockquote><p><strong>Developing products for the NHS at the MedBIC</strong></p><p>The FlipPad™ is one of a number of product innovations being designed by FutureNova. Apple granted a “Made for iPad” developer licence to FutureNova in 2015 and the company has worked closely with Apple to create a range of medical products that will integrate with the iPad and iPhone. The company, who is working with the NHS, plan to supply the FlipPad™ to operating theatres in the UK and expect the FlipPad™ to be used in NHS infection control wards as well as general wards.</p><p>FutureNova is based at the Anglia Ruskin University Business Innovation Centre for Medical and Advanced Engineering (MedBIC) in Chelmsford. The MedBIC is recognised for its work with early stage medical technology businesses and for providing support to speed commercial ideas to market.</p><p><strong>Providing access to patient information in real time</strong></p><p>Preventing risk of infection is a key concern for healthcare providers. Patients with a healthcare associated infection (HCAI) spend an average of 11 extra days in hospital at huge cost to the NHS. Infection prevention is therefore a key theme as the NHS introduces new technologies in a drive to improve patient care. The Department of Health plans to replace older desktop infrastructure with mobile technologies.  This will provide medical practitioners with access to patient information in real time via mobile devices.  With this comes an increased proximity to patients and means bacteria control is vital.</p><p><img alt='FlipPad medical product innovation by FutureNova' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/FlipPadChild_SkypeGranny_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 299px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>The FlipPad™ is easy to clean with standard infection control sprays and the antimicrobial glass coating provides a solution to minimising the spread of infection.  The FlipPad™ is shock-resistant and can be hung from a patients bed. One of its unique features is the ability to use surgeons gloves while operating the touch screen on the FlipPad™.</p><blockquote><p>“Digital innovation is essential to improving the quality of patient care in future and it is clear that mobile technology will be an integral part of that.</p><p>Innovation will be crucial in providing clinicians with the tools they need to improve efficiency and deliver better care for patients including the prevention and management of healthcare-associated infections.”</p><p><br/>Professor Tony Young, National Clinical Director, Innovation NHS England</p></blockquote><p><strong>Taking medical business innovation to market</strong></p><p>The UK MedTech market has an estimated value of £15 billion and has the largest life sciences cluster outside the US. Essex is ideally placed to be positioned as the home of MedTech with its recognised national and international clinical links, high level concentration of MedTech businesses and strategic location.</p><p>MedBIC, the Anglia Ruskin University Business Innovation Centre for Medical and Advanced Engineering is recognised for its work with early stage medical technology businesses. The £6 million centre has been purpose built to speed commercial ideas to market by providing support and help for businesses to develop.</p><p>For more information on the MedBIC see <a href='med-tech-research-and-development-in-essex#.VnklAraLTIU'>here</a>.</p><p>Source [<a href='http://www.futurenova.com/'>FutureNova</a>]</p>
