<p>Essex is an attractive business location for both UK and international businesses who wish to set up a European headquarters or UK office.  With two international ports at Harwich and Tilbury, and nearby Felixstowe making the largest deep sea port cluster in Europe, plus London Stansted Airport, which reaches more European cities than any other European airport, companies are realising that Essex is an ideal location to do business globally.</p><p>Here at INVEST Essex we receive investor enquiries from all over the world - even as far away as Australia. Recently, mining and tunnelling company Rutherford Global Power from New South Wales have been in touch looking to set up a European HQ. They see huge potential in the UK market with major infrastructure projects such as Crossrail and the Thames Tideway, along with many benefits to using Essex as a base to access the European markets.</p><p><img alt='' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Rutherfords_webimage2.jpeg' style='float:left; height:154px; margin:10px; width:234px'/></p><p>“We were looking for a prestigious 5 person office in a strategic location close to London from which we could service major civil engineering contracts.” says Steve Rush, General Manager.</p><p> </p><p>“INVEST Essex offered us a wealth of varied business environments and were successful in finding us new offices, not only close to London but also to Stansted Airport, from where we can be doing business anywhere in Europe by lunch time.”</p><p>“It was important to us that we set up a European HQ that had rapid access to mainland Europe, particularly as we hope to expand the company in the near future. Invest Essex has provided us with valuable business support, not only finding us the right site in a town that has a pool of skilled labour but also good transport links which has been a great help.“</p><p>Now settled in the county Rutherford Global Power are very happy with their location and premises. They have immediate plans for the local recruitment of 3 people and a development plan that will expand their service and support operations, providing a further 40 full time posts in due course.</p><p> </p><p>If you would like to find out more about how INVEST Essex can help you click here</p>
