I look forward to seeing the development of these world-class facilities and the important role they’ll play in keeping Britain safe”</p><p>George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p></blockquote><h3>New facilities jn a perfect location for Life Sciences</h3><p>The new facilities, based on the site currently owned by GSK, will create a centre for research, health improvement and protection working on international health threats, such as Ebola.</p><blockquote><p>'It will also contribute to the Enterprise Zone developments in Harlow and the new world-class public health labs link perfectly with its MedTech focus, as well as increasing the attractiveness of the town for businesses in the science and health sector.  We want the world's best scientists and researchers to work here in Harlow but we also want to improve higher education and the educational and career opportunities for local people. Having world-class labs in Harlow will help to do just that”</p><p>Cllr Clempner, Leader of Harlow Council</p></blockquote><p>This move will further reinforce Harlow's growing reputation as a science-led town, a reputation started in the <a href='http://www.investessex.co.uk/studies/case-studies/fibre-optic-invention'>60’s with the development of Fibre Optic Technology by Nobel prize winner Charles Kao at Standard Telecommunication Laboratories (STL)</a> and continuing today with the development of Harlow Enterprise Zone development, a new development for advanced manufacturing and life sciences/medical technology businesses.</p><h3>Harlow and the London/Stansted/Cambridge Corridor</h3><p><img alt='' src='http://www.investessex.co.uk/uploads/about/1Billion_Public_Investment_150dpi_RGB_copy.jpg' style='border-style:solid; border-width:0px; float:right; height:196px; margin:0px 3px; width:300px'/>Harlow, a major town in West Essex, is at the heart of the London/Stansted/Cambridge Life Sciences corridor which has seen two of the most significant public investments in life sciences research in the UK in the past 50 years totaling £1 Billion in Public Investment. </p><h3>The Harlow Enterprise Zone</h3><p><a href='http://www.investessex.co.uk/studies/place-studies/harlow_enterprise'>Harlow Enterprise Zone</a> is capitalising upon two of the town’s existing strengths – Advanced Manufacturing and Life Sciences.
