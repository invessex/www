<p><img alt='Euraf1 service starts between Northern Europe and West Africa stopping at the Port of Tilbury' src='//clarity-strategies.github.io/ie-uploads/uploads/blog/CMA_300.jpg' style='float:right; height:154px; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px; width:300px'/>A new container route stopped at the Port of Tilbury’s London Container Terminal (LCT) for the first time last week. The inaugural stop at the port is part of a new weekly service between Northern Europe and West Africa by the CMA CGM shipping group.<br/><br/>The Euraf1 service will provide competitive transit times for the export of various commodities and containers between the two continents. The service will have six vessels sailing a weekly rotation of nine ports.</p><blockquote><p>“We are delighted to welcome CMA-CGM’s new Euraf1 service to the Port of Tilbury. I am confident that our excellent levels of service at LCT will meet with expectations, while our current developments such as London Distribution Park, plus the build of one of Europe’s largest chilled warehousing facilities at the container terminal, so close to London, means that LCT is the ideal port for UK exporters and importers looking to access West Africa.”<br/>Angela Black, Head of Commercial, London Container Terminal</p></blockquote><p><strong>Portcentric distribution expansion</strong><br/>The new container route is the latest development in the Port of Tilbury’s distribution expansion. Earlier this year NFT, the UK’s market leader in chilled food distribution, began construction of a £20million refrigerated distribution centre located within the port estate adjacent to the LCT.<br/><br/>The refrigerated distribution centre will integrate with the wider port operations at the Port of Tilbury and LCT and will create a unique portcentric distribution centre.  The port handles over 500,000 containers each year and the distribution centre will be one of the largest refrigerated (“reefer”) quayside facilities in Europe.<br/><br/><strong>Efficient supply chain</strong><br/><img alt='NFT announce construction of £20million refrigerated distribution centre at the Port of Tilbury' src='//clarity-strategies.github.io/ie-uploads/uploads/blog/Port_of_tilbury_chilled_facility_opening_300.jpg' style='float:right; height:201px; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px; width:300px'/>The refrigerated distribution centre is targeted to be open for business by late 2015. It will have capacity for 25,000 pallets within 230,000 sq ft. and be able to handle more than 2.5 million cases per week. NFT’s research identifies this facility will create value and efficiencies in the supply chain and make a considerable contribution towards minimising food miles.<br/><br/><strong>About the Port of Tilbury</strong><br/>The Port of Tilbury is one of the largest deep water ports on the River Thames and the closest port to the City of London. The Port of Tilbury specialises in construction transportation to London, import/export of timber, distribution of paper, and production and distribution of recycled products.<br/><br/>The port is a significant distribution centre covering over 850 acres and is well positioned to access the M25 orbital motorway and the rest of the UK's national motorway network. In addition, there are direct rail connections within the port, with access to the whole of the UK.<br/><br/>Source [<a href='https://forthports.co.uk/media/releases/2828/New+West+African+Service+for+LCT/' target='_blank'>Forth Ports</a>]<br/><br/>See <a href='http://www.investessex.co.uk/studies/place-studies/port-of-tilbury/' target='_blank'>here</a> for more information on the Port of Tilbury.</p>
