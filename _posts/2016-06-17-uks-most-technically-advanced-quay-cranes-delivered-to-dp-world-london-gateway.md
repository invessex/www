<p>Two of the UK's most technically advanced quay cranes were brought up the River Thames on Wednesday. The cranes completed the long sea voyage from China on vessel Zhen Hua 10 via the Cape of Good Hope to arrive at <a href='http://investessex.co.uk/studies/place-studies/london-gateway-port'>DP World London Gateway Port</a>, just 25 miles from central London.</p><h3>Greatest lift-height above water in the UK</h3><p><img alt='' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/Quay_Crane_150616_2.jpg.500px.jpg' style='width: 500px; height: 249px; float: right;'/>When installed they will match DP World London Gateway's existing cranes in providing the greatest lift-height above water of any quay cranes in the UK. At their highest point, the quay cranes stand at 138 metres (459 foot) tall – the same height as the London Eye.</p><p>This investment keeps the UK at the cutting edge of shipping technology and ensures the country remains competitive, by being able to handle the world's largest container ships.</p><h3>Third Berth</h3><p>They are for the third berth at the state-of-the-art container terminal, providing additional trade infrastructure for the UK when the berth opens later this year.  Another two cranes for the third berth are due to arrive in London next week, moving development of the terminal's third berth onto the next stage.</p><p>A further 20 automated stacking cranes and additional 10 modules have already been installed, while in April, the port took delivery of a fleet of hybrid shuttle carriers. Once the third berth is open, DP World London Gateway will have 1250 metres of quay wall, providing three deep-water berths and more ultra-large container vessel capacity than any other port in the UK.</p><blockquote><p>'As an island nation, it is absolutely vital that the UK has world-class port infrastructure to facilitate trade. In addition to the eight already in operation here, the arrival of these quay cranes and further investment in supplementary infrastructure such as our fully automated truck handling capability, ensures that the UK is able to efficiently and reliably handle the largest container ships afloat. <br/><br/>These cranes are unique in the UK. They are safer, more wind resilient, able to lift more containers in one movement and comfortably reach out across and above the largest container ships. With DP World London Gateway, the UK has a port and Logistics Park in the very best location for trade, able to meet the demands of the container shipping industry both now and in the future.<br/><br/>That all contributes to ensuring those importers and exporters who use the facility, will be more competitive, have a more secure supply chain and experience a faster and more efficient delivery at a lower cost.'</p><p>Cameron Thorpe, CEO, DP World London Gateway</p></blockquote><h3>Prime location in the UK</h3><p>Located just 10 miles from the M25 and with a high-performing rail terminal providing direct services daily to all of the UK's major rail freight hubs, the tri-modal terminal opened in November 2013 and is handling cargo from across the globe.</p><p>The port is located on the same estate as one of the UK's largest logistics parks, where work is continuing apace on UPS's 35,000m² parcel sorting hub. That development represents the iconic package and parcel company's largest investment outside of the USA ever, with the facility due to open next year.</p><h3>EUROPE’S LARGEST LOGISTICS PARK</h3><p><a href='logistics-businesses-find-space-for-growth-at-the-uks-multimodal-gateway#.V2PQHuYrLnM'><img alt='' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/blog/lglc_500px.jpg' style='width: 500px; height: 305px; float: right;'/>London Gateway Logistics Park</a>, located within 2 miles of London Gateway Port, the UK’s newest deep sea container port, is set to become Europe’s largest logistics park. The logistics park has been planned to sit directly behind the dockside freight handling facilities and has full multi-modal transport infrastructure.</p><p>It is currently attracting companies who are taking advantage of the port’s reach to 16 million consumers within 50 miles. <a href='ups-to-build-120million-distribution-centre-in-essex#.V2PINOYrLnM'>UPS</a> is the latest company to announce a move to DP World London Gateway Logistics Park. Other new tenants include transport firm Eddie Stobart who has just set up their base at the port.</p><h3>DP WORLD LONDON GATEWAY – THE UK’S MOST ADVANCED HUB</h3><p>Located just 25 miles from central London, DP World London Gateway has 16 million consumers within 50 miles enabling ships to enter the UK closer to the key areas of consumption such as London, Birmingham and Manchester. The port benefits from accessibility via sea, road and rail. There are 11 destinations serviced by the port by rail which offer a highly efficient alternative to road freight.</p><h3>UK MULTIMODAL GATEWAY: ESSEX</h3><p>Establishing operations at UK Multimodal Gateway: Essex can enable logistics and distribution businesses to minimise costs, emissions and risks, maximise flexibility and efficiency in transport planning, and ‘future-proof’ their supply chains.</p><p><a href='../sectors/uk-multimodal-gateway-essex'>Find out more about the UK Multimodal Gateway: Essex</a></p><p>[Source - <a href='http://www.londongateway.com/news/press-releases/enormous-quay-cranes-brought-river-thames-third-berth-uks-new-logistics-hub' onclick='window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no'); return false;'>http://www.londongateway.com/news/press-releases/enormous-quay-cranes-brought-river-thames-third-berth-uks-new-logistics-hub</a> ]</p>
