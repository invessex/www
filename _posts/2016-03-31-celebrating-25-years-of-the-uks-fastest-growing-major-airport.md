Since then the airport…</p><ul><li>Has become one of the UK’s fastest growing airports</li><li>Has added 5 million passengers</li><li>Now offers more European destinations than any other UK airport</li></ul><p><img alt='London Stansted Airport ' src='//clarity-strategies.github.io/ie-uploads/uploads/about/PR03_-_SAT1_STN_FTE_central_area_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>During the last three years, £80 million has been spent on transforming London Stansted Airport’s terminal and, earlier this month, London Stansted Airport was named the ‘Best London Airport’ at the 2016 London Transport Awards. Following on from the recent return of long haul flights to the airport, British Airways has recently announced plans to begin their first ever scheduled flights from the airport.</p><h3>The UK’s fastest growing major airport</h3><p>London Stansted Airport is the busiest single terminal airport in UK serving 23 million passengers a year.  It is advantageously positioned for business travellers and is seen as a core transport hub with unparalleled access to the M11 corridor with a reach of 17 million people within 2 hours and 1.2 million within 30 minutes. The airport has grown to become the largest single employment site in the eastern region.</p><blockquote><p>“London Stansted Airport is the UK’s fastest growing major airport at the heart of the UK’s innovation corridor and we remain focused on providing passengers with even more choice of airlines and destinations to better serve our region’s needs.”</p><p><br/>Andrew Harrison, Chief Strategy Officer, Manchester Airport Group</p></blockquote><p><img alt='FedEx at London Stansted Airport' src='//clarity-strategies.github.io/ie-uploads/uploads/blog/FedEx_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 299px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>The airport has also seen a growing cargo operation with new services to Turkey and China launched last year to join other international heavyweight carriers. The upsurge in operators has seen the airport’s cargo tonnage rise to over 240,000 tonnes up 4.5% on the previous 12 months.</p><h3>Serving European hubs</h3><p>London Stansted Airport is not the only airport in Essex to be expanding its reach. <a href='http://investessex.co.uk/studies/place-studies/london-southend-airport'>London Southend Airport</a>, which has recently received £10 million investment in an expanded terminal, has recently launched flights to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. easyjet will offer the only air route between Essex and the main international airport in the French capital with the airline expecting it to carry 50,000 passengers a year. The route complements London Southend Airport’s route to another European hub, Schiphol Airport, in Amsterdam.</p><blockquote><p>“We’re delighted to be adding a new route to Paris. Our Paris routes across the network have proved extremely popular in both the summer and winter owing to its link for business passengers it brings. We are able to make it easy and affordable to reach both sides of the route providing value for British and French passengers.”</p><p><br/>Neil Slaven, UK Commercial Manager, easyJet</p></blockquote><h3>London’s newest airport</h3><p><img alt='London Southend Airport launches easyjet route to Paris' src='//clarity-strategies.github.io/ie-uploads/uploads/blog/Southend_Paris_flight_400.jpg' style='line-height: 20.8px; width: 400px; height: 299px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/></p><p>London Southend Airport is the eastern gateway to London providing excellent access to Europe for business travellers and urgent freight.
