<p><img alt='Annual passenger growth up 16.1% at London Stansted Airport in annual results' src='//clarity-strategies.github.io/ie-uploads/uploads/blog/Stansted_300px.jpg' style='float:right; height:178px; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px; width:300px'/>Annual passenger growth is up 16.1% at London Stansted Airport in annual results published this week by parent company Manchester Airports Group (MAG). The year’s results showed a total of 20.9 million travellers going through London Stansted Airport with business travellers up 20%.</p><blockquote><p>“Today we had our 13th successive month of double digit growth and it is not a flash in the pan. What’s even more interesting is that business passenger numbers grew even faster – around the 20 per cent mark.”<br/>Andrew Harrison, Managing Director, London Stansted Airport</p></blockquote><p><strong>Business advantage of the London-Stansted-Cambridge corridor</strong><br/>London Stansted Airport is advantageously positioned for business travellers. It is seen as a core transport hub with unparalleled access to the M11 corridor with a reach of 17 million people within 2 hours and 1.2 million within 30 minutes.<br/><br/>The thriving catchment area is part of the growing and increasingly successful London-Stansted-Cambridge economic corridor. The area has strong infrastructure links to the rest of the UK and Europe and close proximity to London, Europe’s no.1 finance hub.</p><blockquote><p>“London Stansted Airport gives airlines access to London, the huge science &amp; technology cluster in Cambridge, East London, Herts, Essex and the whole of East Anglia.</p></blockquote><blockquote>There has been an increase in services that allow business executives to get out to a European destination and back in the same day, which is a tremendous advantage to busy companies. And potential passengers in this catchment don’t have to undergo the ordeal of a one and a half, or even four and a half hour drive to get to Heathrow to catch a plane when they have London Stansted Airport on their doorstep.”<br/>Andrew Harrison, Managing Director, London Stansted Airport</blockquote><p><strong>MAG Group investing in the long haul</strong><br/>The MAG Group is investing in an aggressive growth strategy at the Essex airport with the commercial team visiting global airlines to promote the benefits of the airport. Airline carriers in the Middle East, Far East and the US have recently been visited to show the significance of the catchment area and promote the return of long haul flights to the airport.</p><blockquote><p>“My commercial team and I are going around the world telling top carriers our story. We have to convince American Airlines, for example, sitting in Dallas that their understanding of London and London Stansted Airport is outdated; that the east of our catchment is growing faster than the west; that Cambridge is driving major jobs growth and attracting life science giants such as AstraZeneca and now Illumina, and tech greats such as Apple.”<br/>Andrew Harrison, Managing Director, London Stansted Airport</p></blockquote><p><img alt='Thomas Cook now offering flights to Las Vegas, Orlando &amp; Cancun from London Stansted Airport' src='//clarity-strategies.github.io/ie-uploads/uploads/blog/Nyny_300.jpg' style='float:right; height:303px; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px; width:300px'/></p><p>Thomas Cook has already launched a new schedule of long haul flights to Las Vegas, Orlando and Cancun from London Stansted Airport which is already 98% sold.<br/><br/><strong>Exceptional passenger growth boosting the local economy</strong><br/>When the MAG Group bought Stansted from BAA at the start of 2013, the estimated gross value added to the local economy was £750 million. It is now estimated to be more than £1 billion. <br/><br/>The growth at London Stansted Airport has surpassed the MAG Group’s expectations and demonstrates the potential within the catchment area. The exceptional passenger growth at the Essex airport is faster than at its sister airport in Manchester and means the growth of London Stansted Airport and Manchester Airport exceeds that of Heathrow and Gatwick Airports combined.<br/><br/>Source [<a href='http://www.businessweekly.co.uk/news/travel-and-transport/stansted-airport-owners-long-haul#sthash.lsNkD1kT.dpuf' target='_blank'>Business Weekly</a>] [<a href='http://www.hertsandessexobserver.co.uk/Stansted-Airport-celebrates-unrivalled-growth-MAG/story-27463084-detail/story.html' target='_blank'>Herts &amp; Essex</a>]<br/><br/>See <a href='http://www.investessex.co.uk/studies/place-studies/london-stansted-airport/' target='_blank'>here</a> for more information about London Stansted Airport.</p>
