**Financial technology industry in Essex**  
Financial services and related activities are strong in Essex. They account for almost 90% of Essex’s overall finance and business services sector:  

• Essex is the largest processor of credit card transactions in the UK  
• The county has a key strength in financial administration technology  
• 97,700 people employed in financial and business services in Essex  

The county benefits from a uniquely strategic location in the UK with strong infrastructure links to the rest of the UK and Europe and close proximity to London, Europe’s no.1 finance hub.  

**Rise of the fintech sector**  
The UK is a global hub for finance and business services operations with over two million people employed in the sector. Global investment in financial technology (fintech) companies has tripled in the past year, with the fastest growth witnessed in Europe.

> “Fintech is empowering new competitors and start-ups to move into parts of the banking business but, paradoxically, it is also helping banks to create better, more convenient products and services for their clients."

> Julian Skan, Accenture Managing Director Banking in Europe, Latin America and Africa

The prepaid card market has been the fastest growing form of payment in the past five years. Prepaid card deposits are expected to rise an additional 120% by 2015 to $168.4b globally*.
