<h3>A place where advanced technology meets healthcare…</h3>
<p><img alt="External Robinson building" src="http://www.investessex.co.uk/uploads/about/CRP4,_External_Robinson_Bldg_400.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 299px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;" />In Essex, there’s a strong culture of Research and Development and the application of advanced technologies across high-value market sectors.  The radio frequency, imaging and semiconductor expertise of Essex-based <a href="http://investessex.co.uk/studies/case-studies/e2v-technologies" target="_blank">e2v</a>, which has contributed to the large Hadron Collider and Hubble Telescope projects, is also applied to radiotherapy cancer treatment machines, x-ray systems and life sciences imaging.  Collaboration between Tyco Electronics - world leading experts in sensor technology - and medical device designers, has produced innovative devices for hospital applications and wearable devices for patients.  The electronics consultancy Plextek, which provides solutions for complex engineering challenges, works with companies to solve healthcare problems, applying its expertise to technologies including remote monitoring devices.</p>
<h3>In Essex, advanced imaging and ICT expertise is contributing to breakthroughs in drug discovery and development….</h3>
<p><img alt="Science Village interior" src="../uploads/blog/Science_Village_interior_400.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 299px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;" />Essex is home to both established pharmaceutical businesses such as GSK and AstraZeneca, with their considerable research and development activities, and to highly innovative agile drug discovery and development companies, such as Charles River Laboratories, Isomerase Therapeutics and Isogenica, which belong to the Cambridge biotech cluster <sup>[1]</sup>. These companies rely on advanced technologies across areas including ICT/big data, imaging and advanced manufacturing to enable faster, targeted drug discovery and development. </p>
<p>Niche Biotech companies are also a part of the picture – companies such as Oncologica, specialists in precision oncology testing, and Axol Bioscience, producing specialised human cell cultures and reagents for research.</p>
<h3>A dynamic health technology ecosystem…</h3>
