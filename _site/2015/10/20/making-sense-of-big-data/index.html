<p>Professor Abdel Sahli, University of Essex, demonstrated how his team used data analytics to collect and measure data to maximise container berth efficiency at the port of Felixstowe. </p>
<p>This project delivered tangible savings to the port. Not only was the port able to better deploy costly resources, e.g. terminal and human crane resources, and save money, but also, due to less time spent in the port, the shipping line could employ slow steaming resulting in fuel cost savings and a reduction in emissions.</p>

<p>Simon Hobbs, VP Supply Chain Development UKIN – CEVA Logistics, demonstrated how the world’s third largest logistics company uses data analytics. In a case study of one of its clients, an automotive manufacturer, CEVA were commissioned to model a complete supply chain for itself and its suppliers (both located in China and internationally) both those involved in equipping the factory and supplying components with simulation/variables/scenario analysis to enhance efficiency. </p>

<div>David Eyes, Director of Business Development - Data Interchange, estimated that volume of electronic data in circulation in 2013 would be a mere 5% of the amount in circulation in 2020. David demonstrated a new supply chain tool MMOG/LE and emphasised that managing data relating to component supply was as critical as the failure/shortage of one component (of thousands) in a passenger car, a failure that could stop a production line and cause demand for compensation. </div>
