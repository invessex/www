<p>Two Essex chartered accountant firms have merged to become the largest independent firm in the county. Rickard Keen, which has offices in Southend and Basildon, joins Bird Luckin, based in Chelmsford.</p>
<p>The new firm which will be known as Rickard Luckin Limited will continue to offer a full range of accountancy, tax and business services across Essex and the wider area.</p>
<p><strong>Consolidating presence across the county</strong></p>
<p>The merge will see the two service providers offering a greater breadth and depth of experience to their clients.</p>
<blockquote><div>'We are always looking for ways to improve our service to our clients and to help them be more successful, which is why it was so important to find a firm that shares our personal service ethos.</div><div> </div><div>The range of business sectors and the way individuals and organisations do business has changed hugely over the past 30 years, and continues to evolve at a staggering rate.</div><div> </div><div>As a result, what people want from their service providers has also changed, so we have had to make sure that the expertise, advice and support we provide, and the way we provide it, has kept pace with those changes.</div><div> </div><div>That is why we are delighted that Bird Luckin and Rickard Keen will be joining forces.'</div><div>Ian Plunkett, Managing Director, Bird Luckin</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Expansion and progression</strong></p>
<p>The merger will mean expansion for the company as more staff will be required thereby creating progression opportunities for the existing staff. Client service, business and tax advice will remain central to the company’s operation.</p>
<blockquote><div>'The new firm will give a greater breadth and depth of experience to our clients, but building close long term relationships is what the enlarged firm is passionate about and will maintain at its core. The merged firm will consolidate our presence in the county.</div><div> </div><div>Our team members are all very positive about the change as it will result in new opportunities for them to progress, while also making us very appealing to those looking to start their career in accountancy.</div><div> </div><div>As well as making it easier to recruit, it will help with succession and enable us to compete against the larger national firms, whilst at the same time, give a value for money service to start ups and smaller businesses.'</div><div>Alan Worsdale, Managing Director, Rickard Keen</div></blockquote>
