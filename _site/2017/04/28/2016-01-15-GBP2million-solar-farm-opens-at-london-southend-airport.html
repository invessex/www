The 2.5 megawatt ‘Solar Photovoltaic Array’ consisting of nearly 10,000 individual solar panels is the largest at any UK airport. As well as supplying electricity to London Southend Airport there will be additional capacity for some power from the solar farm to be supplied to the national grid.</p>
<h3>Reducing the carbon footprint</h3>
<p>The solar installation is part of London Southend Airport’s £10m terminal expansion as well as forming part of the airport’s objective to reduce their carbon footprint and their electricity requirement from the national grid. Electricity supplied to the airport by the solar farm will mean avoiding around 1,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions over the next twenty years.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our new solar farm is the largest at a UK airport and supports one of our key objectives, which is reducing our carbon footprint and the electricity we require from the national grid network.  We are delighted as London’s newest airport to have opportunities to introduce the latest ‘green’ initiatives as part of our development.”</p><p><br />Glyn Jones, Chief Executive Officer of Stobart Aviation (owners of London Southend Airport)</p></blockquote>
