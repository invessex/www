<p>As a result of the KTP project, Signal and the University of Essex have cemented a two-year partnership which has also seen Signal undertake huge growth.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Without the KTP programme it would have been very difficult for Signal to achieve all it has done in the last two years. It gave us the ability to bring best-in-class academic talent into the business and it enabled us to develop a truly game-changing product.”</p><p><br />Dr. Martinez-Alvarez, Co-Founder/Head of Research, Signal</p></blockquote>
<h3>A mutually beneficial collaboration</h3>

<p>Signal analyses more than 3.5 million blogs and news sources every day to create targeted feeds. Customers of Signal's technology platform include Jamie Oliver’s Food Revolution Daily site.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The collaboration with Signal has been highly beneficial for all partners and the end of the KTP project will not mark the end of the collaboration. There have already been a number of undergraduate and postgraduate students working at Signal via paid internships and this is expected to continue.”</p><p><br />Professor Kruschwitz, KTP’s academic lead, University of Essex</p></blockquote>
