&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Located between Cambridge and London, but with a significantly lower cost base than either, the county of Essex presents an attractive location proposition to companies in the life sciences and health technology sectors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these are industry sectors in which access to highly skilled workers is key. So does locating in Essex require compromises when it comes to workforce capabilities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;‘Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products’ (SIC C26):&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this key high-technology classification, the Essex districts of Harlow and Maldon display workforce concentrations that are &lt;em&gt;more than 4 x the Great Britain average&lt;/em&gt;, and higher than the core ‘Cambridge Cluster’ districts of Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of workforce numbers, Essex is a match for Cambridgeshire in this classification:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Essex is up there with the very best UK locations when it comes to the availability of a skilled life sciences and health technology labour force.

A skilled labour force across 'health technology' specialisations
A review of UK government (ONS) data [1] for Essex districts reveals high workforce concentrations in three classifications that are key for the health technology sector:

‘Manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products’ (SIC C26):
In this key high-technology classification, the Essex districts of Harlow and Maldon display workforce concentrations that are more than 4 x the Great Britain average, and higher than the core ‘Cambridge Cluster’ districts of Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire.
In terms of workforce numbers, Essex is a match for Cambridgeshire in this classification:

‘Research and experimental development on natural sciences and engineering’ (SIC 721)
Data for this key R&amp;amp;D classification reveals the continuation of the Cambridge life sciences and high-tech cluster southwards into Essex. The Essex district of Uttlesford, which neighbours South Cambridgeshire and includes Chesterford Research Park, displays a workforce concentration in this category of 3.1 x the Great Britain average.
‘Manufacturing of medical and dental instruments and supplies’ (SIC C325)
The Essex districts of Harlow and Southend are home to nationally significant ‘medical instruments manufacturing’ workforce concentrations: 5.3 x the Great Britain average in Harlow and 4.5 x the Great Britain average in Southend.
A reminder of those labour cost savings…
So, Essex is up there with the very best UK locations when it comes to the availability of a skilled life sciences and health technology labour force. But in Essex, those skills come with average labour costs that are significantly lower than Cambridge and London, and even lower than the Great Britain average: [2]

Rapid advances in life science and health technologies are being driven by partnerships between industry and universities, as novel research is applied to solving real life problems. And businesses located in Essex – between Cambridge and London – are ideally positioned to access world-leading university research.
According to the latest university ranking, the cities of Cambridge and London together boast 3 of the world’s top-10 universities (based on overall rankings) and 3 of Europe’s top 6 institutions for life sciences and medicine. [1]
University Rankings [1]University of CambridgeImperial College LondonUniversity College LondonOverall World Ranking3 (joint)87Life Sciences &amp;amp; Medicine (European Ranking)126
Prestigious Research Institutes and Innovation Centres…
Essex’s location within the UK’s life sciences ‘golden triangle’ (London-Oxford-Cambridge) also provides businesses with easy access to world-renowned collaborative Research Institutes and Innovation Centres. These include the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute [2], which is pushing the boundaries of genomic research, The Francis Crick Institute [3], Europe’s largest centre for biological research, and the new, highly innovative £55 million Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst [4], which enables biotech, pharma and medtech businesses to draw upon world-leading expertise, networks, academic support and scientific facilities.
Cambridge, London, and nearby Oxford also host 5 of the UK’s 6 Academic Health Science Centres [5] - joint NHS-University ventures supporting the translation of academic research into healthcare solutions.
And Healthcare and ICT expertise within Essex’s own universities…
Ranked amongst the top 2% of world universities [6], the University of Essex specialises in technologies for the management and transfer of big data, and translational research in the fields of biomedical and health sciences.  Also in Essex, Anglia Ruskin University’s IT Research Institute specialises in medical informatics, imaging, ‘big data’ and the Internet of Things [7].  Anglia Ruskin places great importance on MedTech collaborations and is working with partners to create three MedTech campuses across the county [8].
Providing a thriving culture of research translation and collaboration…
Given this easy access to world-leading research, and the significance of the wider South East England life sciences cluster, [9] it should come as no surprise that Essex is proving an attractive location for established life sciences businesses, as well as spin off companies from both Cambridge and London Universities.

Ventrica provides multilingual eCommerce customer management and communication services in a host of different European languages across a range of business sectors such as fashion, retail, insurance, finance, health, transport, construction and publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2010 during the peak of the recession, Ventrica has experienced phenomenal growth over the last few years and continues to expand with the opening of a Penthouse Suite contact centre which will increase the company’s footprint to 19,000 sq ft and extend its provision from 280 to 480 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
