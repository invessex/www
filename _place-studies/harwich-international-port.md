The port’s cutting-edge technology means goods are transported faster and more efficiently, meeting the demand for logistical efficiency and just-in-time deliveries.<br/><br/>Recent investment allows the port to handle a wide range of freight for various business sectors.

The port’s involvement in this sector extends to a growing UK based supply chain and manufacturing sector within the offshore wind industry.<br/><br/>The port first acted as an installation base for the Gunfleet Sands Offshore Wind Farm. Harwich is now involved in the Greater Gabbard project, which, when complete, will boast an array of 140 turbines producing up to 504MW of energy, making it the largest offshore wind farm in the world.<br/><br/><strong>Major business travel and ferry port</strong></p><p>Harwich is the UK’s third largest cruise port, with 126,000 cruise passengers and 1 million ferry passengers passing through each year.<br/><br/>The port carries large volumes of freight and business travellers on regular ro-ro ferries to Scandinavia and Europe as well as accommodating the world’s largest cruise liners.<br/><br/><strong>Planning for future growth </strong></p><p>Harwich is set to expand with the development of Bathside Bay, a £300 million deep-sea container port. This will enable the port to handle multiple deep-sea container vessels making Harwich potentially the second-largest container port in the UK.<br/><br/>Bathside Bay will also increase the capacity of the port as one of the largest hubs for the offshore energy sector, with the potential to be a multifunctional site for advanced manufacturing and high-tech intelligent warehousing.</p><blockquote><p>“It is important that we are able to provide the best infrastructure available to our customers and this will ensure that the port can handle increased freight and motorist volumes efficiently as demand grows in the future.” David Gledhill, chief executive officer of Hutchison Ports UK Ltd</p></blockquote>
