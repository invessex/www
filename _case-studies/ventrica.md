<div><p><strong>Ventrica – a fast-growing outsourced contact centre business with an impressive international client base.</strong></p><p>Ventrica is an award-winning, outsourced contact centre business based in Southend that started up during the height of the recession and now works on behalf some of the world’s leading brands including the likes of McDonalds, Jimmy Choo, New Look, Canon, UGG and Barratt Homes.</p><p><img alt='Ventrica' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/about/PTAIT_20150112_0588_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>The company provides omni-channel and multi-lingual customer service and telemarketing campaigns for blue chip brands, which want to receive an integrated and unified solution for customer services such as…</p><p>- Professional call management<br/>- Email solutions<br/>- Online customer support and sales<br/>- Review moderation<br/>- Social media monitoring and handling</p><p>Ventrica’s 300+ team provides multilingual eCommerce customer management and communication services in a host of different European languages for businesses across fashion, retail, insurance, finance, health, transport, construction and publishing.</p></div><div><h3>Expanding to meet demand for 24/7 ecommerce sales across Europe</h3><p><img alt='Ventrica' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/about/PTAIT_20150112_0665_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>Ventrica, founded in 2010, has experienced phenomenal growth over the last few years, and continues to grow with the opening of a Penthouse Suite contact centre which will increase the company’s footprint to 19,000 sq ft and extend its provision from 280 to 480 jobs. </p><p>According to analyst Forrester, European online retail sales are estimated to reach €378 billion by 2021. The boom in ecommerce across international borders over the last few years has helped fuel demand for outsourced customer service around the clock, including support for yearly peak events such as Black Friday when brands need to interact with thousands of customers over multiple channels from twitter through to webchat. With its expertise in customer care, digital and native multi-lingual speakers Ventrica has been ideally positioned to capitalise on this opportunity to become one of Southend’s largest employers.</p><p>Ventrica has also recently acquired 35 new employees who were made redundant due to the closure of Converso Contact Centre also based in Southend-on-Sea. New employees will work across a range of customer service, regulatory and IT roles.</p><blockquote><p>“At Ventrica we focus mainly on customer management and have invested heavily in both our people and environment so we can attract and retain the right calibre of talent to provide exceptional customer service and sales management across multiple channels, time-zones and languages.”</p><p>Dino Forte, Managing Director and Founder, Ventrica</p></blockquote><h3>Gaining industry recognition</h3><p>Now regarded as one of the leading outsourcing contact centres in the UK, Ventrica has won numerous industry awards and accolades including…</p><p>- <strong>Plc Awards 2017</strong><br/>Winner - New Company of the Year<br/><strong>- UK CCF Awards 2016</strong> <br/>Winner – Best Customer Contact Centre, large category<br/><strong>- Direct Commerce Association 2015 </strong><br/>Winner – Best Outsourcing Partnership<br/><strong>-</strong> <strong>European Contact Centre and Customer Service Awards 2015</strong> <br/>Silver winner - Best Outsourcing Partnership<br/><strong>- European Contact Centre and Customer Service Awards 2016</strong><br/>Finalist – Best Outsourcing Partnership and Best Contact Centre<br/><strong>-</strong> <strong>CCMA Awards 2016</strong> <br/>Finalists - Best Team Manager category<br/><strong>-</strong> <strong>UK CCF awards 2016 </strong><br/>Finalist - Best Outsourcing Partnership Award </p><p>The prestigious Direct Commerce Association award was won for Ventrica’s work with specialist footwear company VivoBarefoot (<a href='http://www.vivobarefoot.com/' target='_blank'>www.vivobarefoot.com</a>) for whom it provides multi-channel and multi-lingual customer services. These resulted in increased e-sales of 300% and a 73% improvement in international conversion rates.</p><h3>Future plans</h3><p>Due to an increased demand for its omni-channel customer services, an additional site at another location is also part of the company’s future growth strategy for 2017, which will add a further 300 new seats.</p><blockquote><p>“The investment in our new penthouse suite is to meet both the increased demand from existing clients but also to accommodate our future expansion. We have attracted a number of new high profile B2C and B2B brands this year who are part of a wider trend of organisations that are looking to outsource non-core services.</p><p>The whole area of customer experience and sales is becoming more complex and companies now recognise that using a specialist third party makes perfect sense, as they often do not have the expertise, capacity or infrastructure in-house.</p><p>At the same time, not only are customers communicating in different ways there are also massive opportunities to provide around the clock services to take advantage of international markets.  At the moment we are supporting many clients with native-language customer experience speakers in German, French, Italian, Spanish and Dutch, and we expect Cantonese, Mandarin and Japanese to become more popular over the next year or so.”</p><p>Dino Forte, managing director and founder, Ventrica</p></blockquote><h3>Embracing digitalisation for enhanced customer experience</h3><p><img alt='Ventrica' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/about/PTAIT_20150112_0380_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>Ventrica is investing further in its digital capabilities with launching a wholly owned subsidiary, Ventrica Digital. The sister company was established in June 2016 in order to provide a new type and range of customised and results-driven social management services to UK businesses. The company is based at the same location as its parent company in Southend-on-Sea, and within its 80 seat Digital Centre. Ventrica Digital provides a range of digital services for different sizes of companies by managing, monitoring, reporting, growing and increasing reach on all social and digital platforms.</p></div><h3>Working with INVEST Essex</h3><p>Ventrica has been working with <a href='http://investessex.co.uk/' target='_blank'>INVEST Essex</a>, on projects to help the company to grow.
