![Thames Card Technology](//clarity-strategies.github.io/ie-uploads/uploads/studies/Business_Growth_Fund_400.jpg){: .right-image}Thames Card Technology is one of the UK’s largest plastic card manufacturers supplying many blue chip customers across industries including financial services, retail, ID and telecoms, and delivering its product globally to more than 60 countries.

Thames has over 20 years’ experience in manufacturing, personalising and distributing plastic cards for customers all over the world. Operating from a single secure site in Essex the company employs over 200 people and works with clients from various different industries ranging from banking and retail to telecoms and ID.

### Embracing digital technology

Thames Card Technology has seen continual growth in recent years and continues to further expand their client list having added several significant new clients in the banking and travel industries.

The company have also been working with TUI UK & Ireland, manufacturing the next generation of travel money cards. The prepaid cards offer a multi-currency solution for travellers and can be used to make a payment in any country or currency, where the MasterCard symbol is displayed.

### Collaboration with long-term partners

Last year Thames Card Technology worked with partner SIS on a project for Serbia’s leading commercial bank, Komercijalna banka AD Beograd, to produce over one million chip payment cards. The cards are a mixture of prepaid, dual interface (for swipe and tap use) and magnetic stripe gift cards as well as using Dynamic Data Authentication (DDA) for enhanced security.

Thames and SIS have worked together for the past 10 years and the renewal of the Komercijalna banka contract highlights another success borne out of this cross-border collaboration.

> “Our client base continues to demand new ways to improve card services for their customers, which is a key reason why we’ve enjoyed such a long-standing relationship with Thames Card Technology. Without question, they’re a global leader in the production of high quality card solutions, and continue to lead the way in technological innovation, whilst always adhering to strict standards and deadlines.”

### Investment in the company

In 2014 £3.2m growth funding was secured by Thames from the private equity investor Business Growth Fund (BGF) for buying new card manufacturing and printing machinery. This allows the company to manufacture over 250m credit, debit, prepaid, gift and loyalty cards per year. As a result, Thames increased manufacturing capacity by 50% and generated sales of £18m.

> “2014 was a year of huge progress at Thames Card Technology across almost all aspects of our business. BGF’s funding has broadened the range of products and services we are able to offer customers, and enables us to keep up with the ever-growing demand for our services. 2015 promises to be a year in which we continue to capitalise on our unrivalled expertise in the card manufacturing industry.”
