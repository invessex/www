 <p>The Harlow Group, based in Essex, is one of the UK’s leading manufacturers of precision sheet metal components. The company is currently expanding its activities into the demanding aerospace and medical equipment sectors and is enjoying significant export growth.<br/><br/><img alt='Harlow Group, leading manufacturer of precision sheet metal components' src='http://www.investessex.co.uk/uploads/studies/Harlow_Grp_2.jpg' style='float:right; height:438px; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px; width:300px'/>As part of its continuing development, the Harlow Group has participated in the Essex Manufacturing, Innovation and Growth (EMIG) programme managed by the <a href='http://www.investessex.co.uk/services/essex-innovation-programme' target='_blank'>Essex Innovation Programme</a> in partnership with IfM Education and Consultancy Services, the knowledge transfer arm of the Institute for Manufacturing. The EMIG programme provides companies like the Harlow Group with practical support designed to reduce costs and improve productivity.<br/><br/>The Harlow Group qualified to be part of the PrISMS Programme which is run by the IfM ECS and which helps businesses grow in a sustainable way.<br/><br/><strong>How the Institute for Manufacturing helped</strong><br/>Members of the IfM team worked with the Harlow Group on reducing production set-up time, understanding material requirements planning (MRP) and managed a student project on lead-time reduction which resulted in:<br/><br/>• building an extension with environmental considerations at its core<br/>• considering whole-life costs when investing £500k in new technology<br/>• reducing energy costs by £25,000 a year<br/>• revising the factory layout to achieve greater efficiencies<br/>• increasing turnover by 5% per annum<br/>• increasing the number of employees by 7%<br/>• analysing market sectors to identify future opportunities</p><blockquote><p>“Working with IfM ECS has allowed us to have an independent assessment of our business in some key areas. As a result we have managed to save a significant amount of money and explore some great opportunities for improvement.”</p><p>Bill Timpson, Managing Director</p></blockquote><p><strong>New directions</strong><br/>The company’s reputation has also enabled it to win work in the medical equipment market, a sector that is growing rapidly in the company’s base in Harlow.</p><blockquote><p>“We have built a reputation for quality and high precision. This helped us to win the initial contract for aerospace work. We had to make significant changes to our procedures and develop new skills to meet the demanding specifications of the sector. The hard work has paid off and aerospace projects now represent some 20-25 percent of our business.<br/><br/>Our customers have a requirement for sheet metal components that are highly polished. We now have the capability and skill sets.”</p><p>Bill Timpson, Managing Director</p></blockquote><p><strong>Supporting manufacturing efficiency</strong></p><blockquote><p>“We recognise that manufacturers like the Harlow Group operate in a very competitive marketplace. That’s why we are committed to helping Essex companies improve competitiveness and market share through programmes like EMIG.”</p><p>Sarah Bell, Innovation and Sector Development Manager, Essex Innovation Programme</p></blockquote><p>EMIG is a partnership between the Essex Innovation Programme and IfM Education and Consultancy Services, which is the knowledge transfer arm of the Institute for Manufacturing.  Two engineering students spent time at the company investigating the process of lead-time usage within the business. The project gave the Harlow Group an independent view on current practices and improvements.<br/><br/><strong>Essex business advantage</strong><br/>The Harlow Group also benefits from the county’s logistics infrastructure. The business is just a few minutes from the M11 with its links to the national motorway network, making it easy to distribute products throughout the UK.<br/><br/>London Stansted Airport, just 15 minutes away, serves more than 200 cargo destinations worldwide, making it an important link in the company’s global supply and distribution chain.</p><blockquote><p>“We have a growing export business to Europe, USA and Mexico, together with global procurement from China and India. The airfreight and seaport facilities in Essex are vital to that business.”</p><p>Bill Timpson, Managing Director</p></blockquote><p><strong>About the PrISMS Programme</strong><br/>The PrISMS Programme is for SMEs and start-ups in the Eastern Region funded by the European Regional Development Fund. It is managed and delivered by IfM ECS. The programme aims to transform the growth prospects of 50 start-ups and 70 SMEs across the Eastern Region – creating and safeguarding more than 140 jobs.</p><p>For more information on the PrISMS Programme run by the IfM see <a href='http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/services/prisms/' target='_blank'>here</a></p>
