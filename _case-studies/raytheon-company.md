<p><strong>Raytheon Company - Global leader in technology and innovation</strong></p><p><img alt='Raytheon ' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/about/DTR_4_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>Raytheon Company is a technology and innovation leader specialising in defence, national security and other government and commercial markets around the world. The company provides state-of-the-art electronics, mission systems integration and capabilities in the areas of sensing, command, control, communications and intelligence systems and a broad range of mission support services, as well as a range of high technology products and systems.</p><p>Raytheon UK’s facility in Harlow is described by the company as one of their principal design and manufacturing facilities. Harlow has an international reputation in a number of high technology areas and Raytheon has recently announced the signing of a 15-year lease to take over 55,000ft² at the KAO One office building at Harlow KAO Data Campus in order to create its new UK Technical Centre of Excellence.</p><blockquote><p>“This announcement marks a new era for Raytheon in Harlow, where the company has significantly contributed to the economy for more than 50 years. The new facility gives us tremendous potential and will become our main technology centre in the United Kingdom for the design and development of some of the UK's most advanced defence capabilities.”</p><p>Richard Daniel, Chief Executive, Raytheon UK</p></blockquote><h3>Advanced technology from a base in Harlow</h3><p>Raytheon has a long, proud association with Essex. The Harlow site opened in 1958 under the name Cossor. Originally, the company was recognised for its advancements in the technology of radar and identification systems.</p><blockquote><p>“ Today Harlow is one of Raytheon’s principal UK design and manufacturing facilities and has earned global recognition in areas such as air traffic management systems, identification and navigation systems, and network-enabled capabilities.”</p><p>Richard Daniel, Executive Director, Programme Leadership</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>'The company has really helped to place Harlow on the map for advanced technology. The facility in Harlow has provided the world with leading technology in air traffic management systems in more than 40 countries, and it has helped to design secure information and intelligence systems in software development for our forces. This latest investment further boosts Harlow's status as an Enterprise Zone for future innovations in design, manufacturing and engineering. '</p><p>Robert Halfon, Minister of State, Department of Education</p></blockquote><h3>Gaining industry recognition</h3><p><img alt='Raytheon Demo Centre' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/about/Diversity_Image_at_Demo_Center_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>The company’s achievements have been widely acknowledged and recognised by numerous industry awards. Raytheon has won the Sustained Excellence Award for recognition of continued excellence in energy management seven times in a row since 2008, as well as other environmental awards. Raytheon UK has also been awarded by The Royal Air Force a £131 million extension of Raytheon’s contract to manage support services for the Sentinel surveillance aircraft programme.</p><h3>Future expansion</h3><p><img alt='KAO Data building ' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/about/DSC_6775d_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>Raytheon is moving its entire UK Research and Development (R&amp;D) department from its current location in The Pinnacles to the <a href='http://investessex.co.uk/studies/place-studies/harlow_enterprise' target='_blank'>Harlow Enterprise Zone</a> as part of a £25million long-term investment. This commitment will focus on research and development (R&amp;D), export and significant expansion with jobs in Harlow growing from around 350 to around 500.</p><p> </p><p> </p><blockquote><p>'For Raytheon, it is about growing indigenous capability in research, design and development and leveraging our own investment in science and engineering. Industry at all levels, academia and government must work collaboratively to create the right environment for the UK to prosper. We must exploit our competitive advantage in order to drive overseas trade growth, as well as inwards investment into the UK.'</p><p>Richard Daniel, CEO, Raytheon UK</p></blockquote><h3>Working with INVEST Essex</h3><p>INVEST Essex worked closely with the Harlow Enterprise Zone assisting Raytheon to expand their UK operations and and were heavily involved in Raytheon's Regional Growth Fund (RGF) bid.</p><p>In 2016 INVEST Essex was also invited to join a panel session at Raytheon’s Annual Technology Conference for suppliers, customers and defence industry commentators.</p><p>Source [<a href='http://www.raytheon.co.uk/' target='_blank'>Raytheon</a>]</p> <ul class='downloadable-files'><li class='header'>Associated Files</li><li><a alt='' class='btn' href='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/studies/IE_raytheon.pdf' target='_blank'>IE_raytheon .pdf <span>(235 KB)</span></a></li></ul>
