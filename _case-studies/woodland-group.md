The company consists of five divisions, each of them providing logistics services to key industry sectors.</p><p>Since its founding in Basildon in 1988, the Woodland Group has flourished into an international business, employing more than  650 people worldwide, including 250 from within the Essex area.</p><h3>Essex location advantages</h3><p><img alt='Woodland truck' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/about/Woodland_truck_3_400.png' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>With offices across the UK as well as in the USA, Ireland and Hong Kong, the company has had its HQ in Essex for almost 30 years, and attributes a large part of its success to the region’s multimodal transport links.</p><blockquote><p>“Being a business heavily focused on logistics, good transportation links play a major factor in our success.</p><p>In Essex, we have great road, air, sea and rail links right on our doorstep. From the London Gateway and Tilbury ports, to Stanstead, Gatwick and Heathrow airports just along the M25, by being located in Essex we can offer our customers a service that is quick and cost effective.”</p><p>Darren Brundell, AEO and International Compliance, Woodland Group</p></blockquote><h3>Providing skills required by logistics companies</h3><p>Having a location in Essex means the Woodland Group can also benefit from the skills on offer from educational establishments such as the University of Essex and South Essex College which proactively support the logistics sector’s development.</p><blockquote><p><img alt='Woodland truck' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/about/Woodland_truck_4_400.png' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>“Having places of education near to our business, that are willing to work closely with our industry and understand the skills required - not just today, but in the future - is crucial to our continued success, and so we’re working closely with Essex’s education providers to achieve just that.”</p><p>Darren Brundell, AEO and International Compliance, Woodland Group</p></blockquote><p>Woodland Group  offers a diverse workforce for logistics companies, apprenticeships and graduate recruitment or the training and upskilling of existing employees.</p><blockquote><p><img alt='Woodland group' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/about/Woodland_truck_in_depot_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 299px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>“We have run an apprenticeship scheme for the last three  years, which has proved  very successful in terms of helping us recruit and retain the next generation of logistics industry talent.</p><p>We  are also working closely with local education providers to set up  bespoke logistics programs for our staff, as part of our ongoing aim to deliver the best possible training.”</p><p>Darren Brundell, AEO and International Compliance, Woodland Group</p></blockquote><h3>Investing in local businesses</h3><p>The Woodland Group is a great example of a logistics company achieving big things from its base in Essex, using the benefits the county has to offer to ensure its continued success and growth, now and in years to come. According to Woodland Group the region’s businesses are in a ‘great position’ to move forward.</p><blockquote><p><img alt='Woodland depot' src='//images-investessex.firebaseapp.com/uploads/about/Woodland_depot_400.jpg' style='width: 400px; height: 300px; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; float: right;'/>“We are seeing a lot of the small and medium sized enterprises (SME) that we work with growing in size, which is fantastic. We continue to help them where we can so we can mutually benefit from growth in the future.</p><p>Because of our location, we can offer businesses a fast, efficient service, often with significant cost savings due to the transport links from our warehouse across the UK and internationally, too.</p><p>Keeping our headquarters here in Chelmsford, Essex, gives us the edge and enables us to live up to the world-leading reputation that we’ve worked so hard to achieve.”</p><p>Darren Brundell, AEO and International Compliance, Woodland Group</p></blockquote><h3>Working with INVEST Essex</h3><p>INVEST Essex works closely with the Woodland Group supporting with the company’s growth.</p><p>INVEST Essex promotes Essex as a prime UK business solution location to international and UK companies.
